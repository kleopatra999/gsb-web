         visualizations, stills as well as broadcast and cinema quality
         video. It features fully integrated creation suite, offering a
         broad range of essential tools for the creation of 3D content,
         including modeling, uv-mapping, texturing, rigging, weighting,
         animation, particle and other simulation, scripting, rendering,

         alt="" /> Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with
         capabilities similar to Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Xara X, using
         the W3C standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.
         Inkscape supports many advanced SVG features (markers, clones,
         alpha blending, etc.) and great care is taken in designing a
         streamlined interface. It is very easy to edit nodes, perform
         complex path operations, trace bitmaps and much more. For more
         information, see Inkscape&#39;s <a href=

      Technical Info
    </h2>

    <p>
      GSB is comprised of two projects;
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          A complete GNOME distribution for Slackware Linux. Encompasses
          all needed packages for a complete, clean installation of GNOME
          for Slackware. This is the core of the GSB project.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          The GSB source code (the actual Build System) - a collection of
          scripts that build a GNOME release on Slackware Linux. These
          scripts are used to build GSB.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The goal of #2, is to run one script: <strong>GSB.SlackBuild</strong>
      and have it output Slackware packages for a GNOME release.
      <br />
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The latest (forthcoming) stable version of the GSB distro is
      <span class="version"><?php echo($frg_ver); ?></span>
      </li>

      <li>The current (forthcoming) version of the GSB source code is
      <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_ver); ?></span>. It builds
      GNOME <span class="version"><?php echo($frg_ver); ?></span> (this is
      a beta version, if you are unsure wait until stable is released).
      </li>
    </ul>
