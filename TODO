    Freerock Suggests:
    ------------------
        - Package browser based on PACKAGES.TXT, and have a
          PACKAGES.TXT-$FRG_RELEASE_VERSION
          ie. PACKAGES.TXT-0.2.0

        - USER ASSIGNED SOFTWARE. Page that lists which users
          have been assiged to certain packages for testing 
          purposes. Maybe have a separate page with a check
          list to say that they have tested the package.

        - Add svn tarballs to website.

    Malloc Suggests:
    ----------------
        X fix "How can I intall FRG using slapt-get" spelling
        
        X Add slapt-get sources to frg64 port section

        X slapt-get install instructions should now use the meta
          package, and would be "slapt-get --install frgnome"
        
        X slapt-get remove instructions would be the same as the
          current xargs version of the install instructions
          slapt-get --search 'frg$'|awk '{print $1}'| \
               xargs -r slapt-get --remove -y
