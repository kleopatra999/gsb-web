      List Rules and Basic List Etiquette
    </h3>

    <p>
      This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of everything you can and
      cannot do on the list. We just want to foster a friendly, clean,
      good-natured environment for everyone, especially those who are new
      to the Free/Open Source Software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally speaking, though, our list etiquette is pretty much the
      same as most other lists. A <a href=
      "http://www.google.com/search?q=list+etiquette">Google search</a>
      will turn up guidelines for many other lists.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt class="mlist">
        Attachments
      </dt>

      <dd>
          Only PGP or S/MIME signatures and patches are allowed as
          attachments. &quot;Pasted&quot; patches within meessages to the
          development lists are not allowed. Patches MUST be sent in
          <code>.diff</code> or <code>.patch</code> file formats.
      </dd>

      <dt class="mlist">
        Email format
      </dt>

      <dd>
          When posting to the lists, you should post in plain-text format
          only. This means no HTML and no images. If you would like to post
          something involving either, we recommend that you include a URL
          in your post directing users to those materials.
      </dd>

      <dd>
          Use 80 character lines (or less)! Messages with lines greater
          than 80 characters are unsightly and hard to read for most of us.
          Make sure you use less than 80 characters per line in your
          messages, especially if you&#39;re using a Windows mail client.

            Quoting
          </dt>

          <dd>
              We generally prefer in-line quoting, which is quoted text
              followed by the response. For a multi-point post, there
              should be multiple quoted portions, each followed by a
              response. Top-quoting should be avoided, as well as posting
              responses without quoting the referenced text.
          </dd>

          <dt class="mlist">
            Trimming and bottom-posting
          </dt>

          <dd>
              If you are not responding to a particular section, please
              trim that portion of the quotation, unless it provides
              context. In particular, please trim the list footer from your
              reply. It automatically will be re-added when your message
              passes through the list. Also, ALWAYS bottom post. That means
              to not post your reply on top of the original meesage
              you&#39;re replying to!
          </dd>

          <dt class="mlist">
            Me too
          </dt>

          <dd>
              You may agree with much of the material coming across this
              list, but please refrain from replying to an email simply to
              add a simple &quot;Me too&quot; or &quot;I agree&quot; unless
              you have additional information to add to the discussion.

          <dt class="mlist">
            Read the whole thread
          </dt>

          <dd>
              If you check your email (and/or the archives), and there are
              several posts in a thread, please read the entire thread
              before replying. It may be that a solution has already been
              found. If you feel like flaming, it may be that the person
              has already been flamed and has apologized for their mistake.
              There is little more frustrating than being flamed,
              apologizing, and then being re-flamed by someone who
              hasn&#39;t read the thread to the end.

          If you are hosting your own email, please ensure that your system
          clock is in sync with the rest of the world. At the very least,
          it should reflect a time no longer than 24 hours apart from GMT.
          There are numerous utilities which can be installed in a cron job
          to sync your time once a day (e.g. netdate, ntpdate).
