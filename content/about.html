      The GNOME SlackBuild (GSB) Project
    </h2>

    <p>
      GNOME SlackBuild is unique in that it is designed to be a twofold
      project. Its aim is not only to provide users with binary packages
      for an easy installation of GNOME, but also a full GNOME Build
      System, with the goal of allowing individuals to customise and build
      their own GNOME packages for their Slackware system.

      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_distribution.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> This is our binary GNOME distribution for Slackware
         Linux. It encompasses all needed packages for a fully
         configurable, customisable and usable GNOME desktop environment
         for Slackware. There have been a lot of improvements in GNOME
         <?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?>, which include better desktop
         searching, a more organised Evolution email and calendar client,
         enhanced image browsing, simplified control panel, efficient power
         management, and powerful desktop tools, as well as a great new
         documentation web site.

      <?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?> Desktop, please refer to the

    </p>

    <p>
      GNOME SlackBuild is designed to bring the greatest features of GNOME
      to Slackware, integrating seamlessly into a standard install. It uses
      the standard Slackware package system, and <em>aims to replace as few
      packages as possible.</em> For a list of packages that require
      updating, please see the <a href=
      "http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/viewvc/viewvc.cgi/trunk/notes/replaced_packages_gsb-<?php
      echo $gsb_bin_stable; ?>?revision=HEAD&amp;root=gsb">
      replaced packages file</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      GNOME Slackbuild also aims to provide a fully functional desktop, and
      comes with a wide variety of applications in order to create a full
      desktop environment for any user. We have created a short list of
      featured applications, covering areas such as document management,
      office software, multimedia, graphic design, and software
      development.

      GNOME SlackBuild Build System
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_build.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> The build system is full and complete GSB source code we
         use to generate our binary distribution. It is a collection of
         SlackBuild scripts that build a GNOME release on Slackware Linux.
         It also comes with a download script to grab all the latest source
         tarball for every package that GSB can build.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Downloading
    </h4>

    <p>
      The GNOME source files, and source for all the other packages are not
      distributed with GSB, but part of the build process will download the
      source files for you. Our download script is written in Perl, and is
      organised into sections for easy customisation. Version numbers, and
      download locations for all the software packages in GSB are kept
      up-to-date, and you&#39;ll be able to specify local mirrors to help
      speed up your downloads. The majority of the packages come from
      either GNOME Mirrors, or Sourceforge; however a few packages have
      their own individual web site and no local mirrors will be available.
      Your download speeds will vary according to your connection, and you
      need an active internet connection to download the sources.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Building
    </h4>

    <p>
      The source tree is governed by a <code>gsb.SlackBuild</code>, which
      will run build scripts for each of the sections of the GSB Project.
      GSB has been broken into logical sections, such as libraries,
      platform, desktop, applications, and so on. In turn, each section has
      its own master build script which controls what packages and in what
      order things are compiled and installed for that section. Within each
      section, each individual package has its own SlackBuild script which
      will configure, compile, and build its own Slackware package.
    </p>

    <p>
      The GSB Build System is aimed at all levels of users. Those who are
      new to Slackware or to Linux as a whole will find the GSB Build
      System easy to use, and rather simple to modify. Intermediate and
      advanced users will find it heavily customisable, and will be pleased
      to find that the majority of the grunt work in designing and building
      packages is done for them; they will be free to tweak or patch any
      packages to their own taste.
