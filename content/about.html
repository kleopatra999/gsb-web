      The GNOME SlackBuild (GSB) Project
    </h2>

    <p>
      GNOME SlackBuild is unique in that it is designed to be a twofold
      project. Its aim is not only to provide users with binary packages
      for an easy installation of GNOME, but also a full GNOME Build
      System, with the goal of allowing individuals to customise and build
      their own GNOME packages for their Slackware system.

         alt="" /> This is our binary GNOME distribution for Slackware
         Linux. It encompasses all needed packages for a fully
         configurable, customisable and usable GNOME desktop environment
         for Slackware. There have been a lot of improvements in GNOME
         <?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?>, which include better desktop
         searching, a more organised Evolution email and calendar client,
         enhanced image browsing, simplified control panel, efficient power
         management, and powerful desktop tools, as well as a great new
         documentation web site.

    <p>
      GNOME SlackBuild is designed to bring the greatest features of GNOME
      to Slackware, integrating seamlessly into a standard install. It uses
      the standard Slackware package system, and <em>aims to replace as few
      packages as possible.</em> For a list of packages that require
      updating, please see the <a
	      href="http://mirrors.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/gsb-<?php echo
          $gsb_bin_stable; ?>_slackware-<?php echo($slack_ver); ?>/SLACKWARE_REPLACED_PACKAGES.TXT">
          Replaced Packages List</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      GNOME Slackbuild also aims to provide a fully functional desktop, and
      comes with a wide variety of applications in order to create a full
      desktop environment for any user. We have created a short list of
      featured applications, covering areas such as document management,
      office software, multimedia, graphic design, and software
      development.

      GNOME SlackBuild Build System ("GSB Source Code")
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_build.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> The build system is the full and complete GSB source code we
         use to generate our binary distribution. It is our custom build
         program as well as a collection of SlackBuild scripts which
         together,  builds a GNOME release on Slackware Linux.
         Our build system can automatically grab all the source code
         for every package that GSB builds.
