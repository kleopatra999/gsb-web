      Configuring the GNOME SlackBuild Desktop
    </h2>

    This page is meant to be a small reference page for users new to GNOME, or to
    GNOME SlackBuild.  It highlights some of the most useful configuration settings
    that many users will want to, and even need to configure, in order to get the most
    out of their GNOME SlackBuild desktop.  

    <h3 id="about-avahi">
      Avahi Zeroconf <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/avahi.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on
         a local network. This means that you can plug your laptop or
         computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people
         who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files
         being shared. The system daemon that makes all this happen is not
         configured to start automatically at each system boot. If you
         would like to enable the Avahi Zeroconf system with GNOME, you
         will need to enable the daemon. You can do this by running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The system <code>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</code> will start these services
      if they are executable. You can also start the service by hand by
      running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ . /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon start
$ . /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd start
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you wish to later disable Avahi, remove the executable flag from
      the above scripts.
    </p>

    <h3 id="about-nm">
      NetworkManager <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/nm.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />By default, NetworkManager and the NetworkManager panel
         applet are disabled. This is to prevent any accidental conflict
         with previous system networking configurations. Luckily, however,
         NetworkManager and the GNOME Panel applet are very easy to enable.
    </p>

    <h4 id="nm-daemon">
      System Daemon <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      If you haven&#39;t rebooted after installing GNOME SlackBuild, you
      might want to. NetworkManager and the applet install a few
      configuration files into the dbus system messaging system, and this
      daemon will need to be restarted. Restarting the system is one
      method, the other method of course is simply to restart the system
      service. On Slackware, you need to switch to the
      <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory, and run
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ ./rc.messagebus restart
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will reload the dbus configuration. After this you will need to
      make the <code>rc.networkmanager</code> script executable. You can do
      this, while still within the <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory by
      running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ chmod +x rc.networkmanager
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The rc.networkmanager script is run by rc.local at system boot.
      Making this file executable will allow the NetworkManager daemon, as
      well as a dbus-capable wpa_supplicant daemon (for wireless networks)
      to run at system startup. To start the NetworkManager daemon
      immediately, run:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ ./rc.networkmanager start
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will start the NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant daemon. But how
      do you actually come to use the software? That&#39;s where the
      NetworkManager GNOME panel applet comes in. After logging in the
      GNOME Desktop Environment, &quot;Network Manager&quot; can be found
      in the GNOME Menu under &quot;Applications&quot; and
      &quot;Internet&quot;. Clicking this will start the panel applet. You
      will then be able to select various networks detected and decide
      which one to connect to. You may also be asked for a password for the
      GNOME Keyring. The keyring will store all the separate passwords for
      each of the networks (if they require one) in a wallet. The keyring
      password you supply will then be asked again when you connect to the
      networks a second time. You will then need only remember this one
      password, and not all the individual passwords for all the different
      networks.
    </p>

      Proper Permissions <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Because Slackware does not come with PAM support, NetworkManager
      needs to be configured with default group-level permissions. This
      means that users will not be able to connect to the NetworkManager
      daemon, or use the panel applet until they have added themselves to
      the <strong>netdev</strong> group in <code>/etc/group</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As root, you will need to edit the <code>/etc/group</code> file and
      add in user names to the netdev group.
    </p>

    <h4 id="nm-applet">
      GNOME Panel Applet <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      You can find the NetworkManager applet in the "Applications" and "Internet" menu.
      You may also wish that the NetworkManager GNOME Panel applet start every time
      you log in. If this is the case, there are two ways. You could
      use the GNOME Session Manager from the GNOME Control Panel, or else
      create a softlink in your home directory to autostart the
      NetworkManager applet.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the directory doesn&#39;t already exist, you will need to create
      it.
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
$ cd ~/.config/autostart
$ ln -s /usr/share/applications/nm-applet.desktop
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will force the NetworkManager applet to start with your
      gnome-session. If you would like to make this applet start
      system-wide, then create the link in your
      <code>/usr/share/gnome/autostart</code> directory.
    </p>

    <h3 id="about-tracker">
      Tracker (or Beagle) Desktop Search <span class="toc-link"><a href=
      "#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/tracker.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Tracker is a tool designed to extract information and
         metadata about your personal data so that it can be searched
         easily and quickly. By using Tracker, you no longer have to
         remember where you&#39;ve left your files. To locate a file you
         only need to remember something about it, such as a word in the
         document or the artist of the song. This is because as well as
         searching for files in the traditional way, by name and location.
         There is a background daemon that runs idly in the background
         cataloguing and indexing all the files within the configured
         directories. In order to enable tracker (or beagle), you will need
         to start up these daemons. You can load these at the start of your
         GNOME Session with the following.
    </p>

    <p>
      (If the directory doesn&#39;t already exist, you will need to create
      it.)
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
$ cd ~/.config/autostart
$ ln -s /usr/share/applications/tracker-applet.desktop
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will configure the GNOME Tracker applet to appear on the panel at
      the next session start. If you would like to start the applet
      manually, you need to run:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ tracker-applet
</pre>
    <p>
      After the applet has start, you will need to configure the
      directories that the indexing service will keep an eye on for
      updates. You can do this by using the &quot;Preferences&quot; dialog
      after right-clicking on the panel applet.

      <img src="/images/app-icons/compiz.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> GNOME SlackBuild includes Compiz-fusion, which is a 
         compositing window manager that uses 3D graphics acceleration 
         via OpenGL. It provides various new graphical effects and 
         features on any desktop environment, including GNOME. It is the 
         result of the re-unification of the Beryl-project and the community
         around the Compiz Window Manager. It seeks to provide an easy and
         fun-to-use windowing environment, allowing use of the graphics
         hardware to provide impressive effects, amazing speed and unrivalled
         usefulness.
    </p>

    <h4 id="compiz-gnome">
      Using Compiz with GNOME SlackBuild <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      GNOME SlackBuild comes with both an <code>/etc/X11/xinitrc.gnome</code>, 
      which is the X startup script for a gnome-session with Metacity as the
      default window manager.  We have also provided an <code>/etc/X11/xinitrc.compiz-gnome</code>
      script to use the compiz window manager instead. First be sure
      to have your video card properly configured for AIGLX.  There is lots of
      information about doing this on the web, both for Nvidia or ATI drivers.
    </p>

    <h5>Using startx</h5>

    <p>
      If you prefer <code>startx</code> rather than GDM to start your X session,
      then you should copy one of the both (whichever you prefer) to your
      <code>~/.xinitrc</code>.  You can then tweak the scripts to your convenience.    
    </p>    

    <h5>Using GDM</h5>

    <p>
      If you use GDM, then you will find a "Compiz GNOME" in the list under the 
      "Sessions" menu.  This will start the compiz window manager instead of the 
      Metacity window manager, which is started by the default "GNOME" session.  
    </p>

    <h5>The compiz-manager script</h5>
    
    <p>
      This script will check your settings and detect whether compiz can run, 
      and if so, start it up.  Otherwise, the script will start metacity instead. 
      It tends to be more fail proof than simply running compiz.  If you are unsure whether
      compiz will start on its own, start a default "GNOME" session with metacity and
      test using this script.
    </p>
      
<div>
<pre>
$ /usr/bin/compiz-manager
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
    This script will start up compiz and the gtk-window-decorator, and give some
    debugging information to help you detect why compiz cannot start up properly.
    If compiz starts without any trouble, then you will find it easier to switch
    to one of the above listed methods, either copying <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.compiz-gnome</code>
    to your home directory, or use the "Compiz GNOME" session from GDM
    </p>

    <p><img src="/images/app-icons/ati.png" class="listimg-l"
       alt="" />
       Using the <strong>latest</strong> ATI proprietary drivers (fglrx) released January 18th, 2008, you
       should be able to get compiz working quite well.  AIGLX is now supported by the
       driver, and using compiz-fusion 0.6.2 it is both quite stable and rather fast.
       If mostly works out-of-the-box, however, you'll need to tweak your <code>xorg.conf</code>
       a small bit in order to fix a few graphical issues with fonts and icons.
       Make sure your xorg.conf file has the below in the Device section.
    </p>
    
<div>
<pre>
Section "Device"
        Identifier  "aticonfig-Device[0]"
        Driver      "fglrx"
        Option "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps" "true"
        Option "EnableDepthMoves" "on"
EndSection
</pre>
</div>	

    <p>
       The above should allow you to use compiz-fusion and ATI fglrx drivers with success.

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gdm.png"
      class="listimg-l"
      alt="" /> GDM (the GNOME Display Manager) provides an alternate display manager
      for the X Window System. The X Window System by default uses the XDM
      display manager. However, resolving XDM configuration issues typically
      involves editing a configuration file. GDM allows users to customize
      or troubleshoot settings without having to resort to a command line.
      Users can pick their session type on a per-login basis. GDM also
      features easy customisation with themes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you would like to enable GDM on system boot, you will need to edit 
      <code>/etc/inittab</code> and change the default run level from 3 to 4.
    </p>

    <div>
<pre>
# Default runlevel. (Do not set to 0 or 6)
id:4:initdefault:
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      Then, run <code>xwmconfig</code> and select the GNOME entry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       If you are interested in installing new GDM themes, your best starting point is then
       <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=150">GDM Themes</a> 
       available from GNOME-Look.org.  Just download the tarballs to a temporary directory
       and use the GDM theme installer you can find from the GDM main login screen.   
    </p>

      alt="" /> We try our best to be able to provide a GNOME distribution that 
      works well alongside KDE, the desktop that comes by default with Slackware,
      without modifying the default settings too much, or by over patching the 
      source software.  There are a few things that a GNOME SlackBuild user can 
      do to make the integration a little nicer between the two desktop.

    </h4>

    <p>
       By default, GDM is the preferred display manager of Slackware.  When entering 
       runlevel 4, which starts the display manager, Slackware first tries GDM,
       secondly KDM, and lastly XDM.  GDM is configured to properly start a GNOME
       session by running the <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.gnome</code> script.
       On the other hand, KDE comes configured with the bare minimum gnome session
       script which will not work with GNOME SlackBuild.  If you prefer KDM, and would
       like to start a gnome session, <b>you will need to modify</b>:    
    </p>
       
    <p>
       <code>/usr/share/apps/kdm/sessions/gnome.desktop</code>
    </p>

     <p>to:</p>
<div>
<pre>
Exec=/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.gnome
</pre>
</div>

    <p>Your other option is to copy <code>/usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop</code>
       to <code>/usr/share/apps/kde/sessions</code>.  This will correct the default

    <p>
       The default GNOME menus have been configured in GNOME SlackBuild to exclude
       KDE and XFCE menu items to avoid clutter and general ugliness.  Some users
       may find that they would like to access their KDE menu items from the GNOME
       menus.  We have provided a package to do this for you.  You will need to install
       the <b>gsb-gnome-menus</b> package.

    <p>
       This package is based on gnome-menu-extended by Ariszló, and places a submenu 
       in the GNOME menus for easy access to KDE applications.  If you would like
       to restore the previous "exclusive" menu, you'll need to (as root) move
       the saved menu template <code>/etc/gnome/xdg/menus/applications.menu.orig</code>
       to <code>/etc/gnome/xdg/menus/applications.menu</code>, overwriting the

     <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/printer.png"
      class="listimg-l"
      alt="" /> The easiest way of using printing with the GNOME Desktop is via CUPS.
      CUPS uses the  Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis for managing
      print jobs and queues and adds network printer browsing and PostScript 
      Printer Description ("PPD") based printing options to support real-world
      printing. GNOME SlackBuild comes with the system-config-printer utility, 
      which has been borrowed from RedHat.  It can can be used to configure a 
      CUPS server (often the local machine) using the standard CUPS API. 
      The tool is written in Python, using pygtk for the graphical parts.
      It is largely the same as using the CUPS web interface for configuring printers, 
      but has the advantage of being a native application rather than a web page. It
      allows for easy installing of new printers, configuring your existing printers, 
      and supports basic pop-up notification of low ink, and other messages.
    </p>
    
    <p>In order to use system-config-printer, you must make sure that the CUPS daemon
    is running in the background.  You can start the CUPS services for Slackware at system
    start by making the rc script executable.

      to use in order to access your pluggable devices, from external USB drives, to digital
      cameras, MP3 players, iPods and so forth.  These devices will not work unless you have
      added the username to the <code>/etc/group</code> group permissions.  As root, run
      <code>vigr</code> and add your name to the <b>plugdev</b> group.  Afterward, you will
      need to make sure that you logoff and logon for the changes to take effect.
