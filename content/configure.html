      Avahi Zeroconf <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/avahi.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on
         a local network. This means that you can plug your laptop or
         computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people
         who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files
         being shared. The system daemon that makes all this happen is not
         configured to start automatically at each system boot. If you
         would like to enable the Avahi Zeroconf system with GNOME, you
         will need to enable the daemon. You can do this by running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The system <code>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</code> will start these services
      if they are executable. You can also start the service by hand by
      running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ . /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon start
$ . /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd start
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you wish to later disable Avahi, remove the exectuable flag from
      the above scripts.
    </p>

    <h3 id="about-nm">
      NetworkManager <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/nm.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />By default, NetworkManager and the NetworkManager panel
         applet are disabled. This is to prevent any accidental conflict
         with previous system networking configurations. Luckily, however,
         NetworkManager and the GNOME Panel applet are very easy to enable.
    </p>

    <h4 id="nm-daemon">
      System Daemon <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      If you haven&#39;t rebooted after installing GNOME SlackBuild, you
      might want to. NetworkManager and the applet install a few
      configuration files into the dbus system messaging system, and this
      daemon will need to be restarted. Restarting the system is one
      method, the other method of course is simply to restart the system
      service. On Slackware, you need to switch to the
      <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory, and run
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ ./rc.messagebus restart
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will reload the dbus configuration. After this you will need to
      make the <code>rc.networkmanager</code> script executable. You can do
      this, while still within the <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory by
      running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ chmod +x rc.networkmanager
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The rc.networkmanager script is run by rc.local at system boot.
      Making this file executable will allow the NetworkManager daemon, as
      well as a dbus-capable wpa_supplicant daemon (for wireless networks)
      to run at system startup. To start the NetworkManager daemon
      immediately, run:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ ./rc.networkmanager start
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will start the NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant daemon. But how
      do you actually come to use the software? That&#39;s where the
      NetworkManager GNOME panel applet comes in. After logging in the
      GNOME Desktop Environment, &quot;Network Manager&quot; can be found
      in the GNOME Menu under &quot;Applications&quot; and
      &quot;Internet&quot;. Clicking this will start the panel applet. You
      will then be able to select various networks detected and decide
      which one to connect to. You may also be asked for a password for the
      GNOME Keyring. The keyring will store all the seperate passwords for
      each of the networks (if they require one) in a wallet. The keyring
      password you supply will then be asked again when you connect to the
      networks a second time. You will then need only remember this one
      password, and not all the individual passwords for all the different
      networks.

      Proper Permissions <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Because Slackware does not come with PAM support, NetworkManager
      needs to be configured with default group-level permissions. This
      means that users will not be able to connect to the NetworkManager
      daemon, or use the panel applet until they have added themselves to
      the <strong>netdev</strong> group in <code>/etc/group</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As root, you will need to edit the <code>/etc/group</code> file and
      add in user names to the netdev group.
    </p>

    <h4 id="nm-applet">
      GNOME Panel Applet <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      You may also wish that the NetworkManager GNOME Panel applet start
      when you log in. If this is the case, there are two ways. You could
      use the GNOME Session Manager from the GNOME Control Panel, or else
      create a softlink in your home directory to autostart the
      NetworkManager applet.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the directory doesn&#39;t already exist, you will need to create
      it.
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
$ cd ~/.config/autostart
$ ln -s /usr/share/applications/nm-applet.desktop
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will force the NetworkManager applet to start with your
      gnome-session. If you would like to make this applet start
      system-wide, then create the link in your
      <code>/usr/share/gnome/autostart</code> directory.
    </p>

    <h3 id="about-tracker">
      Tracker (or Beagle) Desktop Search <span class="toc-link"><a href=
      "#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/tracker.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Tracker is a tool designed to extract information and
         metadata about your personal data so that it can be searched
         easily and quickly. By using Tracker, you no longer have to
         remember where you&#39;ve left your files. To locate a file you
         only need to remember something about it, such as a word in the
         document or the artist of the song. This is because as well as
         searching for files in the traditional way, by name and location.
         There is a background daemon that runs idly in the background
         cataloguing and indexing all the files within the configured
         directories. In order to enable tracker (or beagle), you will need
         to start up these daemons. You can load these at the start of your
         GNOME Session with the following.
    </p>

    <p>
      (If the directory doesn&#39;t already exist, you will need to create
      it.)
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
$ cd ~/.config/autostart
$ ln -s /usr/share/applications/tracker-applet.desktop
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This wil configure the GNOME Tracker applet to appear on the panel at
      the next session start. If you would like to start the applet
      manually, you need to run:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ tracker-applet
</pre>
    <p>
      After the applet has start, you will need to configure the
      directories that the indexing service will keep an eye on for
      updates. You can do this by using the &quot;Preferences&quot; dialog
      after right-clicking on the panel applet.
    </p>

    <h3 id="about-compiz">
      Compiz <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/compiz.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Compiz, at the moment, doesn&#39;t have an xinitrc
         written for it yet, and we are planning on doing that. We will
         also need to write a proper a gdm session file. (For those of you
         who want to use Xgl). If you want to use compiz when you start
         your GNOME Session, then your best bet is to put
         &quot;compiz-manager&quot; in your session startup (through GNOME
         Control Panel), or else, following the same method above,
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
$ cd ~/.config/autostart
$ ln -s /usr/bin/compiz-manager
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      We are toying with the idea of providing a Xgl server for those
      Slackware users who are interested. Properly configuring an AIGLX X
      server can be notoriously difficult, particularly if you are an ATI
      owner. We are unable to assist users in setting up their X server,
      but we will help out as much as we can with any configuration
      problems with compiz itself.

         other things of that sort.

    <ul>
      <li>To get proper scoring working with gnome-games, you have to add
      the user name to group &quot;games&quot;.
      </li>

      <li>gnome-volume-control will whine about &quot;No Audio Device&quot;
      if the user is not in the group &quot;audio&quot;. Follow similar
      instruction above with NetworkManager.
      </li>

      <li>Administrative utilities, like time-date-admin, shares-admin,
      sabayon, etc, will only complain that the user doesn&#39;t have the
      proper rights to change the settings. If you use these applications
      enough on a regular basis to warrant keeping them in the menu, and
      you would like a prompt for a root password, edit the menu entry
      (using Alacarte, right click on the GNOME menu, then right click on
      properties), and append &quot;gksu&quot; to the command.
