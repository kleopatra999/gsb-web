         It's recommended that you configure ALSA for PulseAudio, since most applications use 
         ALSA. This is done through the PulseAudio plugin for alsalibs (the ALSA PulseAudio 
         plugin is available through our alsa-plugins package). In order for ALSA to use 
         PulseAudio you need to configure the /etc/asound.conf.  There is an example version
         which comes with the pulseaudio package (it may be named /etc/asound.conf.new if there
         was a previous version).  Please make sure the following lines are found in /etc/asound.conf:
    </p>        
    
    <div>
      <pre>
        pcm.pulse {
          type pulse

          }
        pcm.!default {

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/avahi.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on
         a local network. This means that you can plug your laptop or
         computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people
         who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files
         being shared. The system daemon that makes all this happen is not
         configured to start automatically at each system boot. If you
         would like to enable the Avahi Zeroconf system with GNOME, you
         will need to enable the daemon. You can do this by running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The system <code>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</code> will start these services
      if they are executable. You can also start the service by hand by
      running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ . /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidaemon start
$ . /etc/rc.d/rc.avahidnsconfd start
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you wish to later disable Avahi, remove the executable flag from
      the above scripts.
    </p>

    <p><b>New</b>: We now include the <b>Zerconf Service Browser</b> GNOME panel applet which 
    allows you to easily search and connect to local network services, such as 
    WebDAV, VNC remote sessions, ssh, http, telnet and DAAP multimedia.

      <img src="/images/app-icons/changelog.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />In order to prevent KDE and GNOME from interfering with each
         other's menus, we have placed the GNOME Standard menu structure in 
         <code>/etc/gnome/xdg</code>.  Some users, by not starting GSB GNOME in
         a proper fashion, may find that their menus have gone missing.  The
         package <strong>gnome-session</strong> installs a file <code>
         /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.gnome</code>, and this file ought to be copied
         to your user's home directory (~/.xinitrc) in order to use <strong>startx
         </strong> to start an X session.  
    </p>

    <p>In this startup script is an environment variable.  By specifying this 
    in a custom startup script, your GSB GNOME session will be able to find
    its menus. 
    </p>

<div>
<pre>
export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/xdg:/etc/gnome/xdg
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
    GNOME sessions started through GDM will have this variable defined for them.
    Please make sure to have the latest gnome-session and gnome-desktop package
    installed.

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/pulseaudio.png"
         class="listimg-l" alt="" /> Pulseaudio is now installed as the default GNOME
         SlackBuild sound server.  Pulseaudio has many cool features for your 
         desktop, including transferring the audio to a different machine, 
         changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds,
         or changing the volume for different applications all running at one. 
         For instance, you can turn the volume down on music playing in the background
         while turning up the volume for a game or movie playing in the foreground.  
    </p>    
    
    <p>
    In order to get sound in your GNOME Desktop:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>You'll need to "Enable software sound mixing (ESD)" from your Sound 
          control panel.</strong>  This starts pulseaudio (which has replaced esd).  
          For new users, this is on by default.  If you have a previous GNOME setup 
          and have this disabled, you may notice a lack of sound.  :)
        </li>

        <li>
          Make sure that the "PulseAudio Sound Server" devices are choosen in your
          Device panel.  GSB GNOME is now configured by default to use Pulseaudio, so 
          applications like Rhythmbox, Totem, etc, will use it.  However, you may have to
          set it manually to PulseAudio when upgrading from a previous GNOME version.
          You can also switch between using PulseAudio, ALSA, etc, by choosing from the 
          "Devices" menu in the Sound Control Panel.   
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
       The <b>padevchooser</b> is configured to autostart, and you can access all the 
       fancy options and features of pulseaudio directly from your GNOME panel.    
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>Note:</b> PulseAudio works great with Avahi! It will allow you to discover
       and browse remote sound servers, or even share your sound server and speakers with other
       users.

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/nm.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />By default, NetworkManager and the NetworkManager panel
         applet are disabled. This is to prevent any accidental conflict
         with previous system networking configurations. Luckily, however,
         NetworkManager and the GNOME Panel applet are very easy to enable.
    </p>

      System Daemon <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      If you haven&#39;t rebooted after installing GNOME SlackBuild, you
      might want to. NetworkManager and the applet install a few
      configuration files into the dbus system messaging system, and this
      daemon will need to be restarted. Restarting the system is one
      method, the other method of course is simply to restart the system
      service. On Slackware, you need to switch to the
      <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory, and run
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ ./rc.messagebus restart
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will reload the dbus configuration. After this you will need to
      make the <code>rc.networkmanager</code> script executable. You can do
      this, while still within the <code>/etc/rc.d/</code> directory by
      running:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ chmod +x rc.networkmanager
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      The rc.networkmanager script is run by rc.local at system boot.
      Making this file executable will allow the NetworkManager daemon, as
      well as a dbus-capable wpa_supplicant daemon (for wireless networks)
      to run at system startup. To start the NetworkManager daemon
      immediately, run:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ ./rc.networkmanager start
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This will start the NetworkManager and wpa_supplicant daemon. But how
      do you actually come to use the software? That&#39;s where the
      NetworkManager GNOME panel applet comes in. After logging in the
      GNOME Desktop Environment, &quot;Network Manager&quot; can be found
      in the GNOME Menu under &quot;Applications&quot; and
      &quot;Internet&quot;. Clicking this will start the panel applet. You
      will then be able to select various networks detected and decide
      which one to connect to. You may also be asked for a password for the
      GNOME Keyring. The keyring will store all the separate passwords for
      each of the networks (if they require one) in a wallet. The keyring
      password you supply will then be asked again when you connect to the
      networks a second time. You will then need only remember this one
      password, and not all the individual passwords for all the different
      networks.

      Proper Permissions <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Because Slackware does not come with PAM support, NetworkManager
      needs to be configured with default group-level permissions. This
      means that users will not be able to connect to the NetworkManager
      daemon, or use the panel applet until they have added themselves to
      the <strong>netdev</strong> group in <code>/etc/group</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As root, you will need to edit the <code>/etc/group</code> file and
      add in user names to the netdev group.

    <h3 id="about-compiz">
      Compiz <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/compiz.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> GNOME SlackBuild includes Compiz-fusion, which is a 
         compositing window manager that uses 3D graphics acceleration 
         via OpenGL. It provides various new graphical effects and 
         features on any desktop environment, including GNOME. It is the 
         result of the re-unification of the Beryl-project and the community
         around the Compiz Window Manager. It seeks to provide an easy and
         fun-to-use windowing environment, allowing use of the graphics
         hardware to provide impressive effects, amazing speed and unrivalled
         usefulness.
    </p>

    <p>
      GNOME SlackBuild comes with both an <code>/etc/X11/xinitrc.gnome</code>, 
      which is the X startup script for a gnome-session with Metacity as the
      default window manager.  We have also provided an <code>/etc/X11/xinitrc.compiz-gnome</code>
      script to use the compiz window manager instead. First be sure
      to have your video card properly configured for AIGLX.  There is lots of
      information about doing this on the web, both for Nvidia or ATI drivers.
    </p>

    <h5>Using startx</h5>

    <p>
      If you prefer <code>startx</code> rather than GDM to start your X session,
      then you should copy one of the both (whichever you prefer) to your
      <code>~/.xinitrc</code>.  You can then tweak the scripts to your convenience.    
    </p>    

    <h5>Using GDM</h5>

    <p>
      If you use GDM, then you will find a "Compiz GNOME" in the list under the 
      "Sessions" menu.  This will start the compiz window manager instead of the 
      Metacity window manager, which is started by the default "GNOME" session.  
    </p>

    <h5>The compiz-manager script</h5>
    
    <p>
      This script will check your settings and detect whether compiz can run, 
      and if so, start it up.  Otherwise, the script will start metacity instead. 
      It tends to be more fail proof than simply running compiz.  If you are unsure whether
      compiz will start on its own, start a default "GNOME" session with metacity and
      test using this script.
    </p>
      
<div>
<pre>
$ /usr/bin/compiz-manager
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
    This script will start up compiz and the gtk-window-decorator, and give some
    debugging information to help you detect why compiz cannot start up properly.
    If compiz starts without any trouble, then you will find it easier to switch
    to one of the above listed methods, either copying <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.compiz-gnome</code>
    to your home directory, or use the "Compiz GNOME" session from GDM
    </p>

       alt="" />
       Using the <strong>latest</strong> ATI proprietary drivers (fglrx) released January 18th, 2008, you
       should be able to get compiz working quite well.  AIGLX is now supported by the
       driver, and using compiz-fusion 0.6.2 it is both quite stable and rather fast.
       If mostly works out-of-the-box, however, you'll need to tweak your <code>xorg.conf</code>
       a small bit in order to fix a few graphical issues with fonts and icons.
       Make sure your xorg.conf file has the below in the Device section.
    </p>
    
<div>
<pre>
Section "Device"
        Identifier  "aticonfig-Device[0]"
        Driver      "fglrx"

        Option "TexturedVideoSync" "True"

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gdm.png"
      class="listimg-l"
      alt="" /> GDM (the GNOME Display Manager) provides an alternate display manager
      for the X Window System. The X Window System by default uses the XDM
      display manager. However, resolving XDM configuration issues typically
      involves editing a configuration file. GDM allows users to customize
      or troubleshoot settings without having to resort to a command line.
      Users can pick their session type on a per-login basis. GDM also
      features easy customisation with themes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you would like to enable GDM on system boot, you will need to edit 
      <code>/etc/inittab</code> and change the default run level from 3 to 4.
    </p>

    <div>
<pre>
# Default runlevel. (Do not set to 0 or 6)
id:4:initdefault:
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      Then, run <code>xwmconfig</code> and select the GNOME entry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
       If you are interested in installing new GDM themes, your best starting point is then
       <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=150">GDM Themes</a> 
       available from GNOME-Look.org.  Just download the tarballs to a temporary directory
       and use the GDM theme installer you can find from the GDM main login screen.   
    </p>

    <p>You can also find the GNOME Display Manager manual

      works well alongside KDE, the desktop that comes by default with Slackware,
      without modifying the default settings too much, or by over patching the 
      source software.  There are a few things that a GNOME SlackBuild user can 
      do to make the integration a little nicer between the two desktop.

    </h4>

    <p>
       By default, GDM is the preferred display manager of Slackware.  When entering 
       runlevel 4, which starts the display manager, Slackware first tries GDM,
       secondly KDM, and lastly XDM.  GDM is configured to properly start a GNOME
       session by running the <code>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.gnome</code> script.
       On the other hand, KDE comes configured with the bare minimum gnome session
       script which will not work with GNOME SlackBuild.  If you prefer KDM, and would
       like to start a gnome session, <b>you will need to modify</b>:    
    </p>
       
    <p>
       <code>/usr/share/apps/kdm/sessions/gnome.desktop</code>
    </p>

     <p>to:</p>

    <p>Your other option is to copy <code>/usr/share/xsessions/gnome.desktop</code>
       to <code>/usr/share/apps/kde/sessions</code>.  This will correct the default

       menus.  We have provided a package to do this for you.  You will need to install
       the some GNOME GSB menus packages.  
    </p>    
    
<div>
<pre>
slapt-get --install gnome-menus-kde
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
       This package is based on gnome-menu-extended by Ariszló, and places a submenu 
       in the GNOME menus for easy access to KDE applications.  If you would like
       to restore the previous "exclusive" menu, you'll need to (as root) remove
       the <b>gnome-menus-kde</b> package.
    </p>
    
    <p>The above applies for Xfce menus;  instead of gnome-menus-kde, install
    or remove the package <b>gnome-menus-xfce</b>

      <img src="/images/app-icons/printer.png"

      alt="" /> The easiest way of using printing with the GNOME Desktop is via CUPS.
      CUPS uses the  Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis for managing
      print jobs and queues and adds network printer browsing and PostScript 
      Printer Description ("PPD") based printing options to support real-world
      printing. GNOME SlackBuild comes with the system-config-printer utility, 
      which has been borrowed from RedHat.  It can can be used to configure a 
      CUPS server (often the local machine) using the standard CUPS API. 
      The tool is written in Python, using pygtk for the graphical parts.
      It is largely the same as using the CUPS web interface for configuring printers, 
      but has the advantage of being a native application rather than a web page. It
      allows for easy installing of new printers, configuring your existing printers, 
      and supports basic pop-up notification of low ink, and other messages.
    </p>
    
    <p>In order to use system-config-printer, you must make sure that the CUPS daemon
    is running in the background.  You can start the CUPS services for Slackware at system
    start by making the rc script executable. 
    </p>

    <div>
<pre>
$ chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.cups
</pre>
    </div>    

    <p>If you use a HP printer, you may also wish to install the <strong>hplip</strong> and
    <strong>qt</strong> Slackware packages for HP printer support.</p>

      to use in order to access your pluggable devices, from external USB drives, to digital
      cameras, MP3 players, iPods and so forth.  These devices will not work unless you have
      added the username to the <code>/etc/group</code> group permissions.  As root, run
      <code>vigr</code> and add your name to the <b>plugdev</b> group.  Afterward, you will
      need to make sure that you logoff and logon for the changes to take effect.
