Rules for the #gsb IRC chat room
--------------------------------

Admins for the chat room are:

    *  chipster (channel founder)
    *  fidesratio
    *  malloc
    *  Tadgy

The admins are also the project's core developers.

General rules
=============

    *  Registered and ID'd:
       You must be registered and identified with freenode's nickserv
       and services to join #gsb.  This is intentional.  It helps
       to deter the lazy and unmotivated from entering our channel and
       asking questions they could likely answer on their own.
       
       Private messages asking how to register and ID will likely get
       you banned from the channel because you aren't taking initiative
       to learn on your own.

    *  DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
       Meaning, don't expect us to hold your hand and solve the problem
       for you.  You are expected to to the legwork, and we'll support
       you if you show evidence that you have.  Use google!  We will +q
       you if you aren't showing any motivation or legwork.

       Please be certain you have read the FAQs on our website, perused
       the mailing list articles, and looked at the bug reports (open
       and closed) before you ask!

       There's an old saying:  "Teach a man to fish [...]"  That is how
       we operate.  Look it up.

    *  Germane topics:
       Unlike the elitist asshats in ##slackware[1] and #httpd, we
       encourage off-topic discussion.  It brings life to our room, and
       we're lower traffic which allows for general discussion.  There is
       one exception to this rule:
       
       When asking for support, it had better be GSB-related!

       [1] Exempted from this classification are actual Slackware
           developers/admins in the channel.  Stand-up guys and fair.
           Funny how /actual/ project developers aren't fuckfaces, and
           the non-contributors are the asshats.

    *  Attitude:
       Have a good one.  Be patient, courteous, polite, and kiss a little
       ass.  When you're asking for support, we're trying to help you for
       free.  Also, we develop this project for free.  A shitty attitude
       will get you nowhere but +q'd.  It's OK to be a freeloader (in some
       cases), but not an asshat freeloader.

    *  PM's:
       Don't do it without asking first.  Ever.  If you were +q'd or
       banned from the channel, and you PM an admin, you will be making
       it worse for yourself.

    *  Swearing, dirty words, etc.
       Highly encouraged!  Mocking members of other countries allowed
       as long as it's in good taste and not hateful and racist.  Name
       calling with the intent of insulting someone is discouraged.

    *  Pasting snippets, code, errors, etc.
       DON'T do this in the channel.  Use a pastebin and post the
       link to it.  We prefer you use <http://gsb.pastebin.com>
