      About the GNOME SlackBuild Modules for Slax

         alt="" /> 
         <a href="http://www.slax.org">Slax</a> is a modern, portable, small and fast 
         Linux operating system, which is based on Slackware, and has a powerful and
         extendable modular design.  Slax runs from CDs, USB Flash Key, MP3 Players, Cameras or
         even from a hard drive. The only thing missing from this handy distribution?  
         A GNOME desktop! And so we created set of Slax modules which bring GSB to your pocket computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The modular approach gives us the ability to include any GSB software in Slax easily. 
        If you're missing your favourite GNOME office suite, games, or tools, simply download 
	the module and copy it to the Slax <code>modules/</code> directory, no need to fiddle around, 
        no need to configure.  
    </p>
    
    <p>        
        As well, because Slax can be up and running on a USB key in a matter of minutes, it's a good
        way to give GSB a test-run before installing it on a Slackware or Slamd64 system.
    </p>

      The most current available version of the GSB Slax Modules are

      <span class="str hilite-rd">Requirements:</span>  The GSB Modules are designed and 
      built for Slax <span class="version"><?php echo($slax_ver); ?></span>.  
      They will not work on earlier versions of Slax.

	 You can get Slax from the Slax website in several formats, but we've tested the GSB modules on Slax only 
	 for USB. <span class="hilite-gr">Running GSB from a USB key is the recommended method.</span> (At least for the moment.)
	 Follow the steps below to have a Slax system up and running with GSB.
   </p>

    <p>
      NOTE: <i>Because the GSB modules are a new venture, we haven't had a chance to throughly test them for the CD version of Slax, 
      and so it is not recommended that you use the CD version of Slax with the GSB modules.  You might as well spare yourself
      wasting your blank CDs.  </i>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
	  <p>
          You can find the USB version of Slax <a href="http://www.slax.org/get_slax.php">here.</a> You will
          need a USB key (or similar device) about 512MB or larger (1 GB recommended for office modules, 
	  and extra work space, depending on how much you want to store on your file system.) Download the tar file.
	  </p>
        </li>

        <li>
	  <p>
          Untar the slax-<?php echo($slax_ver); ?>.tar to a working partition on the USB key. 
	  </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
          Once it has been untarred, you'll need to make the USB key bootable.  If you're doing this 
          from Linux, make sure you have the 'rd' module (for <b>Ramdisk Support</b>) loaded into 
	  your running kernel.  You may need to run: <code>modprobe rd</code>
	  </p>
          
	  <p>
	  Once you have done that, from the slax partition where you have untarred Slax, run:
	  <code>./boot/liloinst.sh</code>
	  </p>
            
	  <p>
	  This handy script will make the USB key bootable. If you're doing this from Windows
          (for example, if you're a new comer to Linux), then instead run the <b>liloinst.bat</b> 
          to make the USB key bootable.
          </p>
            
          <p>
          <span class="str hilite-rd">Note:</span>  Make sure to run the liloinst script, as this also sets
          up the 'changes' directory, which will store any changes you make to your Slax filesystems.  
          This is very important if you want to store anything on your USB key after booting and 
          keep changes to your system configuration as if on a regular persistent file system.        
          </p>
        </li>
           
        <li>
	  <p>
          Before installing any modules to your new Slax system, you may want to give it a test.  Make 
          sure your computer's BIOS is configured to boot from the USB device first.  Reboot, and you 
          should have a nicely working Slax system up and running.   
	  </p>
        </li>
          
        <li>
	  <p>
          Adding GSB to a Slax system is easy.  You'll need a minimum of two required modules: 
	  the <b>gsb.required</b>, and the <b>gsb.base</b> modules.  You'll need to download these
          two LZM modules and copy them into the <code>slax/modules</code> directory.  
          You can ignore the -devel and -doc modules, unless you want the man pages, help files,
          or developement headers.  For a more detailed description of each module, see below.   
	  </p>
        </li>

        <li>
	  <p>
	  Reboot, <span class="str hilite-rd">making sure your USB is your first BIOS boot device. </span>
	  The GSB modules should configure themselves on first boot.  Login to your new Slax system following 
	  the instructions on the screen.  
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  You'll need to first run <code>xconf</code>, which should autodetect and setup
          your X.org, and then run <code>xwmconfg</code> to select GSB as your desktop.  You can set
          up other users or configure your running system using the standard Slackware tools which 
          come with Slax.

      This is the main GSB Slax Module. It contains only the runtime libraries and binaries required to use GSB in Slax.  
      It doesn't contain any development related files (like headers, etc) or any documentation (such as man pages).  
      If you want these extras, then you'll need to download the attendant modules named with a <code>-doc</code> or a
      <code>-devel</code> extension.
