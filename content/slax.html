      About the GNOME SlackBuild Modules

         <a href="http://www.slax.org">Slax</a> is a modern, portable, small and fast 
         Linux operating system, which is based on Slackware, and has a powerful and
         extendable modular design.  Slax runs from CDs, USB Flash Key, MP3 Players, Cameras or
         even from a hard drive. The only thing missing from this handy distribution?  
         A GNOME desktop! And so we created set of Slax modules which bring GSB to your pocket computer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The modular approach gives us the ability to include any GSB software in Slax easily. 
        If you're missing your favourite GNOME office suite, games, or tools, simply download 
        the module and copy it to the Slax modules/ directory, no need to fiddle around, 
        no need to configure.  
    </p>
    
    <p>        
        As well, because Slax can be up and running on a USB key in a matter of minutes, it's a good
        way to give GSB a test-run before installing it on a Slackware or Slamd64 system.
    </p>
       
    <p>
      The most current available version of the GSB Slax Modules are
      <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_slax); ?></span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="str hilite-rd">Requirements:</span>  The GSB Modules are designed and 
      built for Slax <span class="version"><strong><?php echo($slax_ver); ?></strong></span>.  
      It will not work on earlier versions of Slax.

      You can get Slax from the Slax website in several formats.  <i>Because the GSB modules are a new venture,
      we haven't had a chance to throughly test them for the CD version of Slax, and so it is not recommended
      that you use the CD version of Slax with the GSB modules.</i>  You might as well spare yourself
      wasting your blank CDs.  On the other hand, we've tested the GSB modules on Slax for USB. It is distributed
      as a TAR archive.  Running GSB from a USB key is the recommended version for the moment.     
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get Slax <?php echo ($slax_ver); ?>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can find the USB version of Slax <a href="http://www.slax.org/get_slax.php">here.</a> You will
            need a USB key (or similar device) about 512MB or larger (1 GB recommended for office modules, 
            and extra work space, depending on how much you want to store on your file system.) 
          </li>
          <li>
            Untar the slax-<?php echo($gsb_slax); ?>.tar to a working partition on the USB key. 
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            Once it has been untarred, you'll need to make the USB key bootable.  If you're doing this 
            from Linux, make sure you have the 'rd' module (for <b>Ramdisk Support</b>) loaded into 
	    your running kernel.  You may need to run: <code>$ modprobe rd </code>
	    </p>
            
            <p>Once you have done that, from the slax partition where you have untarred Slax, run:
	    $./boot/liloinst.sh </p>
            
            <p>This handy script will make the USB key bootable. If you're doing this from Windows
            (for example, if you're a new comer to Linux), then instead run the <b>liloinst.bat</b> 
            to make the USB key bootable.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <span class="str hilite-rd">Note:</span>  Make sure to run the liloinst script, as this also sets
            up the 'changes' directory, which will store any changes you make to your Slax filesystems.  
            This is very important if you want to store anything on your USB key after booting and 
            keep changes to your system configuration as if on a regular persistent file system.        
            </p>
          </li>
           
          <li>
            Before installing any modules to your new Slax system, you may want to give it a test.  Make 
            sure your computer's BIOS is configured to boot from the USB device first.  Reboot, and you 
            should have a nicely working Slax system up and running.   
          </li>
          
          <li>
            Adding GSB to a Slax system is easy.  You'll need a minimum of two required modules: 
            the <b>gsb.required</b>, and the <b>gsb.base modules.</b>  You'll need to download these
            two LZM modules and copy them into the <code>slax/modules</code> directory.  
            You can ignore the -devel and -doc modules, unless you want the man pages, help files,
            or developement headers.  For a more detailed description of each module, see below.   
          </li>

          <li>
            Reboot, making sure your USB is your first boot device.  The GSB modules should configure
            themselves on first boot.  Login to your new Slax system following the instructions on the
            screen.  You'll need to first run <code>xconf</code>, which should autodetect and setup
            your X.org, and then run <code>xwmconfg</code> to select GSB as your desktop.  You can set
            up other users or configure your running system using the standard Slackware tools which 
            come with Slax.

         is considered stable, but with only a few volunteers to help build and test it, we cannot
         guarantee that it is free from errors.  :)  If you find any bugs in the GSB modules for Slax, 
         please help us and the GNOME SlackBuild project out by reporting them.  
         You can report any new issues by sending an email to our mailing list.  You can find all our
