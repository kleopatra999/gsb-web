<h2>Development Information</h2>

<p>
   GNOME SlackBuild is unique in that it is designed to be a twofold
   project. Its aim is not only to provide users with binary packages
   for an easy installation of GNOME, but also a full GNOME Build
   System, with the goal of allowing individuals to customise and build
   their own GNOME packages for their Slackware system.

<h3>
Source Code and Build System
</h3>

<p>We have a wiki dedicated to the management and documentation about our build system. 
We provide our full build system, that is to say, it is the full and complete GSB 
source code we use to generate our binary distribution. It is a collection of 
SlackBuild scripts that build a GNOME release on Slackware Linux. The build system 
also comes with a download script to grab all the latest source tarballs for every 
package that GSB can build.
</p>

<p>The structure of the build system is quite simple. The source tree is governed by a 
gsb.SlackBuild, which will run build scripts for each of the sections of the GSB Project. 
GSB has been broken into logical sections, such as "libraries", "platform", "desktop", 
"applications", and so on. In turn, each section has its own master build script which 
controls what packages and in what order things are compiled and installed for that section. 
Within each section, each individual package has its own SlackBuild script which will 
configure, compile, and build its own Slackware package.
</p>

<p>
The GSB Build System is aimed at all levels of users. Those who are new to Slackware or 
to Linux as a whole will find the GSB Build System easy to use, and rather simple to 
modify. Intermediate and advanced users will find it heavily customisable, and will 
be pleased to find that the majority of the grunt work in designing and building packages 
is done for them; they will be free to tweak or patch any packages to their own taste.
