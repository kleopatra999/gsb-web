      Getting the code from Subversion: <span class="toc-link"><a href=

    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_svn.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> The only method supported of getting the GNOME
         SlackBuild tree is to check out our source code from our svn
         repository. Please make sure to do so in a directory on a disk
         partition that has quite a bit of free space. We have not yet
         unveiled a formal release version, so the most up-to-date build
         tree is found in trunk. You can check out the GSB Build System
         using the following command. &#39;trunk&#39; holds our latest
         build tree and sources. This is where the majority of the work
         goes on for the upcoming stable release. At the moment, trunk is
         quite stable and ready for testing by the general public. When we
         are satisfied that we have a stable release, we will create a
         <?php echo $gsb_bin_update_ver; ?> stable branch. These will be
         even numbered, similar to the GNOME versioning format.

      <img src="/images/app-icons/help.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> The best way to help the project is to use GSB. :^) With
         more users and testers, we are more likely able to catch and fix
         problems. Making sure to report problems you come across is very
         appreciated and helps immensely. The only thing greater than
         reporting a problem is offering a solution! Patches and fixes for
         GSB are welcome, and the easiest and preferred method is to use
         the GSB Development List highlighted above.

    <ul>
      <li>The Small Things Matter
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes the package description file, slack-desc, may have
          improper spelling, or bad grammar. If you spot something, let us
          know.
          </li>

          <li>slack-required files list all the dependencies of each
          package. If you find that a package you installed is missing a
          dependency, please point it out. These small things are sometimes
          accidently overlooked.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Hosting
        <ul>
          <li>MIRRORS are always needed, and the more the better. If you
          can help with hosting and setting up slapt-get repositories,
          please speak up! :)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Translations
        <ul>
          <li>Our web page and slack-desc files are only in English. If you
          are interested in helping translate the web page into other
          languages please let us know.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Testers
        <ul>
          <li>Binary Package Testers will be useful to catch any errors or
          installation problems with the packages we ourselves provide.
          </li>

          <li>Build Tree testers are always welcome. Many individuals will
          prefer the &quot;Build-It-Yourself&quot; method, and we look
          forward to comments and patches from these users.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Graphics
        <ul>
          <li>Good graphics artists are always in high demand! If
          you&#39;re interested in designing icons, splash screen, gdm
          theme, backgrounds, or graphics for the web site, please
          don&#39;t hesitate to send us an email. We&#39;d be very
          interested in hearing from you!

      <li>Suggestions
        <ul>
          <li>Do you think we&#39;re missing something every user of GNOME
          should have? Have a way that GSB can be better? Suggestions are
          welcome! Come along to chat in the #gsb IRC channel or send an
          email to the development list.

      Our Roadmap <span class="toc-link"><a href="#toc"
         title="Go up to TOC">&#8593;</a></span>
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/roadmap.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> What&#39;s the current long term plan for GSB? GNOME is
         under constant development and improvement, and one of our goals
         is to follow it as it progresses. Alongside the current stable
         version of GNOME, we will try to maintain a <var>-current</var>
         branch, which will house the latest and greatest GNOME development
         versions. Below is a brief outline of what we have planned.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Gnome <?php echo $gsb_bin_unstable_ver; ?> Unstable Series
        <ul>
          <li>The GNOME Developers are currently working on GNOME
          <?php echo $gsb_bin_unstable_ver; ?>, an unstable series which
          will eventually turn into a new 2.22 stable branch in about 6
          months. Once our work is finished with GNOME
          <?php echo $gsb_bin_update_ver; ?>, we will create a stable
          branch, and start work on a GSB-current branch, maintaining a
          bleeding-edge GSB series for all the hardcore GNOME enthusiasts.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Gnome <?php echo $gsb_bin_update_ver; ?> Stable Series
        <ul>
          <li>Designed to be built and used on Slackware
          <?php echo $slack_ver; ?>
          </li>

          <li>Binary downloads are currently not available, but should be
          in a few days. Please keep an eye on the downloads page for any
          changes.
          </li>

          <li>The Build system is quite stable now, and the majority of the
          work going on at the moment is bug squashing, and small changes
          to individual packages fixing the odd quirk. If you just
          can&#39;t wait for the binary distribution, give it a try! :)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Gnome 2.16.x -- Finished
      </li>

      <li>Gnome 2.14.x -- Finished
      </li>
    </ul>
