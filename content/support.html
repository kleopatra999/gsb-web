      Getting Support
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li id="list">The preferred means of getting support is to join the 
      <a href="/lists/">GSB User Discussion Mailing List</a> and ask 
      questions. (Note: You must be subscribed to the mailing list in order to post messages).
      </li>

      <li id="irc">You can try for immediate help by dropping by our 
      <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#gsb">#gsb IRC channel on irc.freenode.net</a> 
      and ask questions.  We may not always be around and available to answer, but 
      we do always respond.  (Eventually).  :)  Also note, your IRC nick in
      Freenode must be both registered and identified to join #gsb.  Make
      certain you read our <a href="/irc-rules">IRC chat room rules</a>!
      </li>
      
      <li id="wiki">Another means of reporting bugs is via our Development
      site and bug tracking tool.  If you do not wish to use the mailing
      lists, you can use our <a
      href="http://github.com/gnomeslackbuild/gsb-build-system/issues">bug
      reporting system</a> to register any bugs, errors, or problems.  </li>
      
    </ul>

    <p>
      <span class="hilite-rd">Before you ask questions, please check the
      <a href="#FAQs">FAQs</a>, and search the <a href="/lists/">user
      discussion mailing list archives</a>.  Be certain you have also
      read the <a href="/configure/">configuration notes</a> as well.
      Do your homework first folks - please! :-)</span>
