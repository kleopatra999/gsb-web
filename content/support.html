          <strong>No we do not!</strong> We support GSB on Slackware <?php
          echo $slack_ver; ?> <em>only</em>. You can try to
          install GSB on Slackware-current, but support requests will be
          ignored (and you will risk being mocked!).  Mockery gets worse if
          we must ask you if you're running Slackware-current.

          Note that the &quot;gsb-current&quot; branch is under constant
          development, and may have bugs. Hence, <strong>gsb-current isn&#39;t
          officially supported...ever!</strong>. That branch is specifically made for
          developers and testers only.  Casual users who ask for gsb-current
          support will be ignored and possibly mocked for not reading!
          Mockery gets worse if we must ask you if you're running
          gsb-current ;-) 
          On the lighter side, If you are interested in testing and developing for GSB, you
          should report bugs in gsb-current by using our <a

          You should be able to simply select GNOME by running
          `<code>xwmconfig</code>` (as root). If that doesn&#39;t work, try
          this as a last resort:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Execute the following command <strong>as root</strong>:
            <div>
              <pre>
cd /etc/X11/xinit ; ln -f  xinitrc.gnome xinitrc
</pre>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>Then, using <strong>your own user account</strong>, execute
          the following command:
            <div>
              <pre>
rm ~/.xinitrc
</pre>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>To start GSB/GNOME:
            <div>
              <pre>
startx
</pre>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          You may also want to consider setting your <code>/etc/initab</code> to
          <code>init 4</code>, to start the graphical environment
          automatically.

        <q>What&#39;s the difference between GSB and Dropline GNOME?</q>
      </dt>

      <dd class="faqentry">
        <p>
          Not a whole lot, actually. Dropline GNOME is a similar project,
          and has been around longer. It&#39;s simply another
          choice/alternative of a GNOME distribution for Slackware. GSB
          does not &quot;compete&quot; with Dropline. Matter of fact, the
          Dropline and GSB teams collaborate together periodically. Some
          folks however, do appreciate that GSB does not add <a href=
          "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_Authentication_Modules">PAM</a>
          to Slackware, and tries to replace as few standard Slackware packages
          as possible.<br /><br />
          We also get the dreaded <q>why don't you guys merge with project
          X?</q>  Please don't ask that question.  If we want to merge, we'd
          merge.  We're proud of our project, and we think that our project
          is the best GNOME for Slackware since it was dropped from Slack.

      <dd class="faqentry">
        <p>
          Please note that when uninstalling, you will have to reinstall
          some packages from the &quot;<code>l</code>&quot; package set (and
          possibly others). Please refer to the <a href=
          "http://mirrors.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/gsb-<?php echo $gsb_bin_stable;

    <p>This will remove all packages that are provided by GNOME SlackBuild.  You'll need
    to comment out the SOURCE for GNOME SlackBuild in your <code>/etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc</code> 
    file. Then make sure to rerun <code> slapt-get --update</code>.  After you have 
    uninstalled GNOME SlackBuild, you'll need to reinstall a few standard Slackware packages
    by running:</p>

<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --install glib2 libwnck
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
     You may also need to reinstall other packages that may have been replaced, such as mozilla-firefox,
     libgsf, or compiz.

        <p>
          The KDE menus might be changed if you install GSB because of the

          freedesktop.org desktop menu specification. There is a simple fix
          for this. Just add the following near the top of the startkde
          script:
        </p>

        <div>
          <pre>
$ export XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=/etc/kde/xdg
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          If the improper menus persist, run kbuildsycoca from Konsole
          after you have logged into KDE.
