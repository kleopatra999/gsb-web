      This page describes how to build the binary GSB distribution from the
      actual GSB source code. <span class="hilite">It is recommended that

      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_svn.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> The first step to building your GNOME Desktop with GSB
         is to check out our source code from our svn repository. Please
         make sure to do so in a directory on a disk partition that has
         quite a bit of free space. The GSB Build System itself doesn&#39;t
         not take up much disk space, however, the source tarballs are
         downloaded directory into the build tree. <b>A full source build
         tree can take up to 1GB of disk space.</b> We have not yet
         unveiled a formal release version, so the most up-to-date build
         tree is found in trunk. You can check out the GSB Build System
         using the following command.
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ svn co <a href=
"http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/trunk">http://svn.gnomeslackbuild.org/gsb/trunk</a> gsb
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This may take a long time depending on the speed of your internet
      connection. The svn GSB tree does not only contain our own scripts
      and patches for building the GNOME Desktop, but also contains
      external links to other software available via svn, such as the x264
      Codec library, and applications such as gnucash. These external links
      via svn will ease the building of such packages. However, the
      majority of the tree will consist of SlackBuild build scripts
      (.SlackBuild), Slackware package description files (slack-desc), and
      Slackware package requirements (slack-required) files.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If you have difficulties building a package, before reporting
      any errors, please make sure your Build Tree is up-to-date. Changes
      to the trunk can happen daily, and the fix may already be applied to
      the build tree.</strong> To update your tree to the latest version,
      change into the <code>gsb</code> directory and run
    </p>

      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_download.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Apart of the GSB Build System is a download script
         written in perl, which is kept up to date with all the versions
         and download locations of all the source tarballs used by the GSB
         Build System. This is for the convenience of any user who wishes
         to build GSB from scratch. The download script is designed to
         download the source tarballs for the entire GSB Build Tree,
         <strong>which can be up to 1GB.</strong> Users may find they
         either do not want this, and may only want to use the GSB Build
         Tree for building a few select packages. In this case it may be
         easier to download the tarballs by hand into each package&#39;s
         directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The perl download script is called <code>gsb_update.pl</code>, and it
      is found in the <code>gsb/bin</code> directory. There are two
      settings you may wish to change before running the download script.
      To do this, you will need to edit the <code>GSB.pm</code> file found
      in the directory <code>gsb/lib/perl/GSB</code>.

      <dd>
        This argument will tell gsb_update.pl to edit the SlackBuild to
        reflect the version number which is downloaded from the GSB.pm
        source files, as well as reset the build number if the version has
        changed.
      </dd>

      <dt>

      </dt>

      <dd>
        This argument will tell gsb_update.pl to tag all the packages with
        &quot;gsb&quot;. When the package is built, the string
        &quot;gsb&quot; will be appended to the package build number, i.e.,
        -1gsb.tgz, rather than -1.tgz. This will help differentiate it from
        regular Slackware provided packages.
      </dd>

         seem surprising at first, but a complete GSB Build may require up
         to 8GB of disk space! There is a lot of software that will be
         compiled during the build process and it is important to ensure
         that enough free disk space is available before starting the build
         scripts. The disk space usage is broken down as such:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <strong>GNOME SlackBuild Source Tree:</strong> ~100MB
      </dt>

      <dd>
        This includes all the GNOME SlackBuild scripts, as well as all
        external svn sources.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <strong>GNOME SlackBuild Source Tarballs:</strong> ~1GB
      </dt>

      <dd>
        This is approximate for a full source download. If you only wish to
        build a few single packages then if may be easier for you to
        download each source tarball individually.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <strong>Temporary building space:</strong> ~4GB.
      </dt>

      <dd>
        Some larger applications like Mozilla Firefox, Mono, and Boost C++
        require enormous amounts of space to build. Despite the fact that
        the resulting binaries are often only about 30MB, while building
        they may need up to 3-4GB for object files and libraries.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <strong>Installed Software:</strong> ~2GB.
      </dt>

      <dd>
        As the GSB Build system steadily progresses building packages, it
        will need to install them on the build system for the sake of
        satisfying dependencies. In other words, the system on which GSB is
        built will also have it installed. A full installation of GSB will
        required approximately 2GB

        <strong>GNOME SlackBuild Packages:</strong> ~650MB
      </dt>

      <dd>
        GNOME SlackBuild will produce standard <code>tgz</code> format
        Slackware packages, placing all the built packages into the default
        directory <code>/tmp/gsb-packages</code>. A full GSB Build will
        require space for about 240 individual packages.

         alt="" /> <strong>A full development system is also required to
         build GSB.</strong> You will need to ensure that the following
         standard Slackware packages are installed on your system:
         <code>autoconf, automake, bin86, binutils, doxygen, flex, gcc,
         gcc-g++, gettext-tools, guile, indent, kernel-headers, libtools,

    <p>
      All of these packages are installed on a &quot;full&quot; Slackware
      install, but some users who installed a custom selection may not have
      these packages installed. They are available on any Slackware CD, or
      available from any Slackware mirror.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those users who are interested, we provide a set of tagfiles to
      be used during a Slackware installation which will install the same
      set of Slackware packages we use on our own build system. They are
      available in the <code>lib/build-box-tagfiles/</code> directory.

         upgraded these packages automatically unless you run the
         <code>gsb.*.SlackBuild</code> with the <code>-upgrade</code>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/build_options.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> When building GSB, there are several environment
         variables which can be used to tweak and customise the build
         process. GSB supports two methods of setting these environment
         variables, described below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first option is to use the bash builtin &quot;export&quot; to
      manually set the option and export it to all sub-processes. This can
      be done with a command like:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ export VAR=&quot;VAL&quot;
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      This can be repeated for as many environment options as you want to
      set. You must remember to set these options every time you begin a
      build process as they will not be saved accross multiple builds.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second option is to create a <code>gsb.options</code> file in the
      src/ directory. The gsb.options file is read at the begining of every
      build process, and the options specified in this file will be saved
      accross multiple builds. Using the <code>gsb.options</code> file is
      especially useful for repeat builds or for developers who want to set
      specific options when testing.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gsb.options file should contain exactly the same
      &quot;export&quot; commands which would be used manually on the
      command line (see above). The advantage of putting them into the
      gsb.options file is that the options will always be read, no matter
      whether you remember to manually export them on the command line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are the common environment variables which can be set to effect,
      tweak or customise the build process:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <var>ARCH</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        Setting the ARCH allows you to over-ride the default base
        architecture type for GSB. You can use this environment option to
        build GSB for, say, x86_64 or the powerpc architecture type. The
        architecture type set when building GSB determines the absolute
        minimum processor type required to run the produced binaries. In
        other words, if you set ARCH=i686 the resulting code will NOT work
        on an i586 or earlier CPU. These ARCH types are currently
        recognised by the GSB SlackBuild scripts: <code>i386, i486, i586,
        i686, x86_64, powerpc</code>.
      </dd>

      <dd class="emph">
        The default is &quot;i586&quot;.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>TUNE</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        This option is very similar to the ARCH environment option except
        that the resulting binaries are scheduler-tuned to the given
        processor type. This means that the binaries will be tuned to run
        with better performance on the CPU type specified with TUNE, but
        will still work without problems on CPU types going back to the
        value specified for ARCH. TUNE can be set to any valid CPU type
        within the architecture type specified with ARCH. For example, if
        ARCH=i586, TUNE could be set to i686. For an ARCH type of x86_64,
        TUNE must be set to one of the 64 bit processor types,
        currently:<code>k8, opteron, athlon64, athlon-fx</code>.
      </dd>

      <dd>
        The default is &quot;i586&quot;, except for an ARCH type of x86_64
        where it is &quot;k8&quot;.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>DISTRO</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        Setting DISTRO to anything other than &quot;slackware&quot; allows
        GSB to be built on different (Slackware based) distributions. For
        example, this can be set to &quot;slamd64&quot; when building GSB
        on the 64 bit Slackware based distro <a href=
        "http://www.slamd64.com">Slamd64</a>.
      </dd>

      <dd class="emph">
        The default is &quot;slackware&quot;, and should not be over-ridden
        unless you are specifically building for another distribution.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>TMP</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        During the package builds, temporary data will need to be stored on
        disk. This option specifies the directory where that temporary data
        can be written. Make sure the default (or any directory you
        specify) has enough free space for the build process, plus the
        completed packages and logs.
      </dd>

      <dd class="emph">
        The default is <code>/tmp</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>PKGDEST</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        Once a package has been built it will be stored in the directory
        specified with this option. The default for this option is affected
        by the value of the TMP environment option detailed above (referred
        to as $TMP below).
      </dd>

      <dd class="emph">
        The default is <code>$TMP/gsb-packages</code>.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>LOGSDIR</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        As the GSB build process proceeds, a log of the output from each
        package build is logged for later debugging. This environment
        option specifies the directory where these log files will be
        stored. This option is not used by individual package SlackBuilds
        but is used by the top-level SlackBuilds which control the build
        processes. The default for this option is affected by the value of
        the TMP environment option detailed above (referred to as $TMP
        below).
      </dd>

         alt="" /> The following options are less common but allow highly
         specific customisation of the build process. You should not set
         these options unless you know exactly what needs to be set for
         each. GSB comes with fairly optimised complier settings, but if
         you really want to squeeze every last cycle out of your CPU, you
         can adjust compiler and make settings. Be wary though! Sometimes
         hyper-optimising can break software that depends on careful or
         ISO-standard math routines, for example, liboil.

      <dd>
        Any options specified in this environment variable are ADDED to the
        package specific options passed to the <code>./configure</code>
        command in the SlackBuilds. If this option is set globally (ie, set
        with export or in gsb.options) it sets the additional options
        passed to <code>./configure</code> for EVERY SlackBuild in GSB.
        Therefore, make sure that any setting given in this environment
        option is valid for EVERY <code>./configure</code> used in GSB.
      </dd>

      <dd class="emph">
        By default, when ARCH=x86_64, <code>./configure</code> is
        automatically passed <code>--libdir=/usr/lib64</code>.

        <var>GSB_TUNE_FLAGS</var>

      <dd>
        This environment option allows you to set the specific tuning
        options gcc should use when compiling/linking the binaries in
        packages. There are many, many gcc options which can be set to
        optimise/tune the binaries - see the gcc man page for full details.
        Setting this option over-rides the default tuning options specified
        in the SlackBuild files - these options are NOT added to the
        default ones. Make sure you add any of the default options from the
        SlackBuilds back to this environment option if you choose to use
        it. Tuning is specific to each ARCH, with the defaults being:
        <dl>
          <dt>
            i386, i486
          </dt>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/sb.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" />The default behaviour of the build script is to skip any
         previously installed package, and continue building the next
         package in the build order. This is to avoid accidently updating
         and removing of any customised, prebuilt, or Slackware default
         packages.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You will need to pass the <code>-update</code>
      argument to build GSB packages that replace any default Slackware
      package.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <var>-force</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        The package will not be built if a package of the same name is
        already installed, or any of the packages required to build are
        missing. This option over-rides these checks and attempts a build
        anyway. It cannot be used with the -update switch.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>-update</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        This switch will make the build script test each package version as
        defined in the SlackBuild script against the currently installed
        package. If there is a difference, the script will remove, rebuild,
        and reinstall the package. It cannot be used with the -force
        switch.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>-no-cleanup</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        By default any temporary source, build and package directories will
        be deleted once the package is built. This option prevents those
        files from being removed.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>-no-install</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        Build the packages but don&#39;t install them. This should only be
        used for testing individual SlackBuilds. It may cause the section
        build to fail when required packages are not installed and the
        dependency checks fail.
      </dd>

      Options are passed down to the next level SlackBuild where

      <img src="/images/app-icons/building.png"

         alt="" /> Building every package provided by GNOME SlackBuild will
         take a long time. We have separated packages into sections in
         order to aid building in a proper order, as well as to make
         maintaining dependencies easier. If you do not wish to run the
         entire build in one go, you may build section by section (ie, by
         hand), following the build order below. We have, however, provided
         there is one overarching script, <code>gsb.SlackBuild</code> which
         will run each of the section SlackBuild&#39;s in the proper order.

      This master list is defined within the <code>gsb.SlackBuild</code>
      file itself, and each section SlackBuild has it&#39;s own defined
      build order. The binary distribution provided compiles every package
      listed, but if you prefer to roll your own GSB packages, then feel
      free to edit the order to suit your own needs or wants. But be
      warned, if everything breaks, it&#39;s not our fault! :^)
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
./gsb.SlackBuild -update

    <p>
      The -update argument is important, and used to upgrade a few standard
      Slackware packages. For more information, see the Build System
      Requirements above.

      If you discover yourself still having difficulty building a certain
      package or packages, let us know and we&#39;ll try our best to
      resolve any issues. Our contact information can be found on the
      <a href="/lists/">Lists</a> web page. Give IRC a try first, but if
      no-one is around, then please do send an email detailing the problem
      you are having, with all the appropriate details, like OS and compile
      versions, the exact error, and steps to reproduce it. You may also
      want to check the archives or FAQ to see if the problem is already
