      What's New in 2.22?
    </h2>

    <p>
      <bold>NOTE 1:  GNOME SlackBuild GNOME 2.22-CURRENT is designed 
      and built for the upcoming Slackware 12.1.  It will not work on Slackware
      12.0.</bold>
    </p>

    <p>
      NOTE 2: Slackware 12.1 is no doubt soon to be released, and when that occurs, 
      we will be rebuilding all our packages against the released stable version 
      of Slackware 12.1.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <bold>This page then is aimed at those users who live on the edge and want to 
      try out the latest GSB Desktop on their Slackware-current installation. It will
      be modified and updated as our "What's New" page when we release a stable version
      of GSB 2.22 for Slackware 12.1.  For now, it aims at giving a basic preview
      of what GNOME SlackBuild 2.22 has in store.	</bold>
    </p>
    
    <p>Below are highlighted some of the major changes found in GSB 2.22.</p>

         alt="" />GNOME <?php echo($gsb_bin_unstable_ver); ?> is the latest
         version of the GNOME Desktop. There have been a lot of
         improvements in GNOME <?php echo($gsb_bin_unstable_ver); ?>, which
         include better networked filesystems, DVD, Digital TV Support, 
         improved Evolution Mail client, the new Remote Desktop Viewer, 
         improved Evince viewer, new features in Accessibility, and
         better Internationalisation. For a complete summary of what is new

      <img src="/images/app-icons/slackware.png"

         alt="" /> GNOME SlackBuild is designed to bring the greatest features 
         of GNOME to Slackware, integrating seamlessly into a standard install while
         at the same time replacing as few system supplied packages as possible.  With
         Slackware 12.1, we have reduced even further our replaced packages list.

         rather than using the now deprecated GNOME-VFS system.  Some features
         are now missing, such as fonts://, but for the most part, it has feature
         partity with the older GNOME-VFS.  Nautilus now handles all disk mounting
         directly, and no longer relies on Gnome Volume Manager, <b>which has been
         removed from GNOME SlackBuild's GNOME Desktop.</b>  File copying is much 
         smoother, as is the access of Network folders via Samba, ObexFTP and WebDAV.

    </h3>

    <p>
      GNOME SlackBuild provides two different window managers for your
      GNOME Desktop, Metacity, which is the default GNOME Window Manager,
      as well as Compiz-Fusion, a Window Manager which offers a wide range
      of spectacular effects for a 3D accelerated desktop.
    </p>

    <h4 id="compiz">
      Compiz-Fusion
    </h4>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/compiz.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Compiz-Fusion has been <b>upgraded</b> to the latest 0.7.2 version.
         Our compiz-fusion package comes with CCSM for easy integration into
         your GNOME desktop, and with two sets of extra plugins for all sorts
         of cool and wacky effects by which you can impress your neighbours.
         For more information, see Compiz-Fusion&#39;s 
         <a href="http://www.compiz-fusion.org/">home page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
       <bold>New:</bold> GNOME SlackBuild now comes with the <b>fusion-icon</b>package
       allowing users to easily switch between their various window managers, like
       Metacity and Compiz, in addition to changing between various <i>window decorators</i>
       like Emerald and the GTK Window Decorator.
    </p>

    <p>
       <bold>New:</bold> The <b>Emerald Decorator</b> is now apart of our GSB Compiz package
       and is the default for Compiz-GNOME.  The Emerald Window Decorator allows theming and
       other various style changes to your Compiz Desktop.
    </p>

    <p>
       <bold>Note:</bold> Slackware 12.1 comes with Compiz, not Compiz-Fusion.  Our package
       is called <code>compiz-fusion</code>, not <code>compiz</code> in order to avoid the 
       confusion.  However, we have specified a "package conflict" with Slackware's package.
       You may want to remove your compiz package and replace it with our Compiz-Fusion package.
       If you're wondering what the difference is, please see their 
       <a href="http://wiki.compiz-fusion.org/FAQ#head-f2b74a26fe4e660b1472e126e829203a4167d97b">

         manager, a fully integrated window manager that uses GTK+ for
         visual elements, communicates tightly with the panel and other
         desktop elements, and is configured straight from the GNOME
         preferences dialogs. It includes full keyboard navigation,
         including navigation to the panel and the desktop background, and
         it very themeable. For more information, see Metacity&#39;s
