    <p>
      <span class="str hilite-rd">NOTE:  GNOME SlackBuild GNOME <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?></span>
      is designed and built for Slackware <span class=

      on Slackware 12.0 or earlier releases.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
       If you are a user of Slackware 12.0, you must upgrade first.  You can find full instructions 
       on how to upgrade by reading the 
       <a href="http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-current/UPGRADE.TXT">
       Slackware UPGRADE.TXT</a>    
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This page then is mainly aimed at those users who were running Slackware 12.0 and 
      GNOME SlackBuild 2.20 and are upgrading their systems rather than installing fresh.  
      If you are a new-comer to GNOME SlackBuild, and running Slackware <?php echo($slack_ver); ?>, please see our 
      <a href="http://gnomeslackbuild.org/download/">Download</a> page for a full set of 
      instructions.  However, this page also contains a list of changes from GSB 2.20 and may
      be of interest to those who are curious about what's happening with GNOME SlackBuild.

         alt="" /> Please follow the instructions available from

         Using slapt-get is the easiest means. Mirrors are available on the download
         page.  Make sure to modify your slapt-getrc files to use the <b>gsb-stable</b> 
         directory rather than <b>gsb-current</b>. (If you were a user of -current previously)
         The upgrade should be smooth for those users of GSB 2.20. There are a few things to note:
    </p>

    <h4>Deprecated Packages</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
        <p>You'll have to remove the <b>gnome-volume-manager</b>, as it has been replaced 
        by gvfs.  If you use slapt-get, you'll see a conflict warning. 
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Our compiz package is now called compiz-fusion to avoid confusion with the 
        Slackware compiz package.  One or the other.  (Fusion is cooler.)
        </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
        <p><b>libmusicbrainz</b>: Slackware no longer offers libmusicbrainz, but Sound-juicer 
        and Rhythmbox still use it, so we have begun to offer the package now.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><b>XML-Simple</b>: This package can be removed.  Slackware offers xml-simple in the 
        perl package.  If you do remove XML-Simple, please remember to do a: 
        </p>
<div>
<pre>
$ removepkg XML-Simple
$ slapt-get --install  --reinstall perl
</pre>
</div>
        <p>This will make sure you have the latest and up-to-date perl package.
        </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
        <p><b>util-linux-ng</b>: The new hal package with Slackware requires the 
	change from <b>util-linux</b> to <b>util-linux-ng</b>.  <span class="str hilite-rd">
	You must replace util-linux with util-linux-ng in order to use HAL automounting with GSB.
        </span> Pat recommends the following:
        </p>

<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --install util-linux-ng
$ removepkg util-linux
$ slapt-get --install util-linux-ng
</pre>
</div>

         <p>Install, remove, and then reinstall again.  I include this as a note, as 
         it may catch a few people off guard when doing the upgrade.
         </p>    
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Packages No Longer Supplied by GNOME SlackBuild</h4>

    <p>
    The following GSB packages can be removed and replaced by the corresponding 
    Slackware version:
    </p>
 
    <p> 
    <code>Pyrex </code> <i>(called pyrex in Slackware)</i><code> gtk+2 libgpod pango pygtk bluez-libs
    icon-naming-utils poppler shared-mime-info bluez-utils libcddb poppler-data 
    tango-icon-theme dbus-glib libcdio libmtp wavpack gnome-icon-theme 
    openldap-client pygobject fuse wpa_supplicant dbus-python XML-Simple </code><i>(this
    is now included in Slackware's perl package)</i>
    </p>

    <p>It's suggested you remove these with removepkg, and the use slapt-get to 
    reinstall the standard Slackware packages.  (Particularly gtk+2) <b>Note:</b> 
    We no longer offer a patched openldap package, but provide an <code>evo-openldap</code>
    package which will not conflict with openldap.  This evo-openldap is used by 
    Evolution for NTLM.

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/nautilus.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> <b>New:</b> The latest version of Nautilus now uses GVFS/GIO
         rather than using the now deprecated GNOME-VFS system.  Some features
         are now missing, such as fonts://, but for the most part, it has feature
         partity with the older GNOME-VFS.  Nautilus now handles all disk mounting
         directly, and no longer relies on Gnome Volume Manager, <b>which has been
         removed from GNOME SlackBuild's GNOME Desktop.</b>  File copying is much 
         smoother, as is the access of Network folders via Samba, ObexFTP and WebDAV.
    </p>    

    <p> GNOME Volume Manager is slowly being deprecated by Nautilus, and now in part causes
    conflicts with Nautilus and desktop management.  Nautilus however has not yet fully replaced
    the Volume Manager, and some functionality (like video camera autostart) may be missing.  Hopefully
    this will soon catch up.

      <img src="/images/app-icons/compiz.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Compiz-Fusion has been <b>upgraded</b> to the latest 0.7.4 version.
         Our compiz-fusion package comes with CCSM for easy integration into
         your GNOME desktop, and with two sets of extra plugins for all sorts
         of cool and wacky effects by which you can impress your neighbours. Compiz
         is easily accessible straight from GDM (the GNOME Display Manager), or using
         Fusion-Icon, you can start, stop, and switch between the Compiz decorators, Metacity
         or any other X Window Manager you prefer.  For more information, see Compiz-Fusion&#39;s 
         <a href="http://www.compiz-fusion.org/">home page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>New:</b> GNOME SlackBuild now comes with the <b>fusion-icon</b> package
       allowing users to easily switch between their various window managers, like
       Metacity and Compiz, in addition to changing between various <i>window decorators</i>
       like Emerald and the GTK Window Decorator.
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>New:</b> The <b>Emerald Decorator</b> is now a part of our GSB Compiz package
       and is the default for Compiz-GNOME.  The Emerald Window Decorator allows Compiz
       theming and other various style changes to your Compiz Desktop.
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>Note:</b> Slackware <?php echo($slack_ver); ?> comes with Compiz, not Compiz-Fusion.  Our package
       is called <code>compiz-fusion</code>, not <code>compiz</code> in order to avoid the 
       confusion.  However, we have specified a "package conflict" with Slackware's package.
       You may want to remove your compiz package and replace it with our Compiz-Fusion package.

         package.  Avant Window Navigator (Awn) is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom 
         of the screen. It has support for launchers, task lists, and third party applets. It
         makes emulation of a Mac cool and easy, and makes for nice eye candy for your GNOME

      <img src="/images/app-icons/metacity.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> GNOME 2.22 officially incorporates the Metacity window
         manager, a fully integrated window manager that uses GTK+ for
         visual elements, communicates tightly with the panel and other
         desktop elements, and is configured straight from the GNOME
         preferences dialogs. It includes full keyboard navigation,
         including navigation to the panel and the desktop background, and
         it very themeable. For more information, see Metacity&#39;s

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/pulseaudio.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> <b>New:</b> Pulseaudio is now installed as the default GNOME
         SlackBuild sound server.  Pulseaudio has many cool features for your 
         desktop, including transferring the audio to a different machine, 
         changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds,
         or changing the volume for different applications all running at one. 
         For instance, you can turn the volume down on music playing in the background
         while turning up the volume for a game or movie playing in the foreground.  
         These are easily achieved using PulseAudio. For more information, see PulseAudio&#39;s
         <a href="http://www.pulseaudio.org/">home page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
         In order to get sound in your GNOME Desktop, you'll need to "Enable software
         sound mixing (ESD)" from your Sound control panel. This starts pulseaudio 
         (which has replaced esd).  For new users, this is on by default.  If you 
         have a previous GNOME setup and have this disabled, you may notice a lack 
         of sound.  :)  GNOME is now configured by default to use Pulseaudio, so 
         applications like Rhythmbox, Totem, etc, will use it.  You can switch between 
         using PulseAudio, ALSA, etc, by choosing from the "Devices" menu in the Sound 
         Control Panel. The <b>padevchooser</b> is configured to autostart, and you can 
         access all the fancy options and features of pulseaudio directly from your GNOME panel.    
    </p>

    <p>
       <b>Note:</b> PulseAudio works great with Avahi! It will allow you to discover
       and browse remote sound servers, or even share your sound server and speakers with other
       users.
