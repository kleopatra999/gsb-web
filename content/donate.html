    <h2>Donate to the GSB Project</h2>

    <p>Many aspects of developing and supporting GSB costs considerable
    amounts of time, but moreover, <strong>money</strong>.  The two main
    mirrors, hosting the shell, web, and email accounts, source code
    reposiitory, the various software used in the development environment,
    and more, are paid out of our own pockets with our own hard-earned
    money.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/9654">Please consider
    donating funds to help support the GSB project</a>.  Donations are
    facilitated by a service called "Pledgie" (endorsed and used by the
    folks who host our source code repository).  They accept many forms of
    payment, including PayPal.</p>
    
    <p>We sincerely appreciate all you can do to help fund this project
    which allows us to give back to the users of Slackware.</p>
