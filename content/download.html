      About the GNOME SlackBuild Binary Distribution
    </h3>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_distribution.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> This is our binary GNOME distribution for Slackware
         Linux. It encompasses all needed packages for a fully
         configurable, customisable and usable GNOME desktop environment
         for Slackware. If you haven&#39;t yet, you should <span
             class="hilite"><a href=
             "/about/">read about the GSB project</a></span> before
         installing GSB.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most current available version of the GSB binary distribution is
      <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?></span>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/slaptget.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> The package management tool used by GNOME SlackBuild is
         slapt-get. Slapt-get tries to emulate Debian&#39;s apt-get as
         closely as possible. It uses native Slackware tools, like
         installpkg, upgradepkg and removepkg, and supports multiple
         package sources. It is also capable of caching packages, resuming
         downloads, checking MD5s, searching packages, and resolving
         dependencies and conflicts. It is the preferred tool when
         installing GNOME SlackBuild. If you would like more information on
         slapt-get please see see Slapt-get&#39;s <a href=
         "http://software.jaos.org/#slapt-get">home page</a>. GSlapt is
         also available, and is a GTK version of slapt-get, which
         integrates well into the GSB GNOME Desktop, and is the default
         package management application.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>slapt-get requirements</strong>: <code>gpgme curl

    <p>
      You can download slapt-get for Slackware v<span class=
      "version"><?php echo($slack_ver); ?></span> from: <a href=
      "http://software.jaos.org/slackpacks/12.0/slapt-get-0.9.12c-i386-1.tgz">
      slapt-get-0.9.12c-i386-1.tgz</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are using a 64-bit platform, you can try slapt-get for
      Slamd64-current: <a href=
      "http://software.jaos.org/slackpacks/current-x86_64/slapt-get-0.9.12b-x86_64-1.tgz">
      slapt-get-0.9.12b-x86_64-1.tgz</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After downloading the slapt-get binary package, you can install it
      with:
    </p>

<div>

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/mirrors.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Once slapt-get is installed, you will need to modify the
         <code>/etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc</code> file to point to local
         mirrors of both a Slackware <span class=
         "version"><?php echo($slack_ver); ?></span> mirror as well as a
         GNOME SlackBuild mirror. You can find a local Slackware mirror
         from the slackware.com mirror list at <a href=
         "http://www.slackware.com/getslack/">http://www.slackware.com/getslack/</a>.
         A full list of available GNOME SlackBuild Mirrors is given below.
         You will need to be aware that there is both an i586 (x86) binary
         version as well as a k8 (x86_64) binary version to choose from.
         Please make sure to select the mirror that reflects the platform
         you run on. x86_64 binaries will not run on Slackware 12.

    <dl>

        SOURCE must be a path to a valid http or ftp Slackware release
        directory, or other package source such as linuxpackages.net, or
        GNOME SlackBuild. All that is required is the PACKAGES.TXT and
        CHECKSUMS.md5. Multiple sources can be defined. Below is a short
        example <code>slapt-getrc</code> file. <strong>Please note: This is
        only an example. Make sure to change your SOURCE to point to local

        WORKINGDIR will hold the package data and downloaded packages. This
        directory will be created automatically as permissions allow. Be
        sure that the directory resides on a partition with a large amount
        of free space, because a full GNOME SlackBuild installation can

        EXCLUDE is a comma separated list of packages you want excluded

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_upgrade.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> After installing and customizing the
         <code>slapt-getrc</code> configuration file, you need to run
         slapt-get with the <var>--update</var> option to download the
         package data available from all the package sources you specified
         within the <code>slapt-getrc</code> file. 
    </p>

    <p>After the package data has been updated, the first step to installing
      GNOME SlackBuild is to <strong>upgrade the required packages</strong>.
      If you do not upgrade the required packages, GNOME SlackBuild will not
      run properly.</p> 
      
   <p>
      Some standard Slackware packages will need to be 
      upgraded, most notably <strong>pango, glib2, gtk+2, and gnome-icon-theme</strong>. 
      Others may need to be upgraded later for added functionality, but these 
      packages are optional. 
   </p>
   
<div>
<pre>
*Required Slackware Updates for GNOME 2.20.3 *

gnome-icon-theme: ( >= 2.20 for gnome-desktop 2.20)
glib2:            ( > 2.14 required by gtk+2 2.12)
pango:            ( > 1.18 required by gtk+2 2.12)
gtk+2:            ( >= 2.12 required for libgnomeui 2.20.0)
</pre>
</div>

   
   <p>
      You can upgrade all these required packages by running:   
   </p>

<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --install pango glib2 gtk+2 gnome-icon-theme
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      Slapt-get should then upgrade only these four specific packages.  
      If you plan on using <strong>NetworkManager</strong> with GNOME, then make sure to upgrade 
      to the GNOME SlackBuild build of <strong>wpa_supplicant</strong>, which contains
      the needed dbus bindings and binary.  Otherwise, this is not a required upgrade.
      There are other packages that may required upgrading, please see the 
      <a href="#adupgrades">Additional Upgrades</a> section.
    </p>

<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --install wpa_supplicant

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_install.png"
      class="listimg-l"
      alt="" /> After upgrading the required packages, you are now
      ready to install GNOME SlackBuild.  GNOME SlackBuild provides 
      a number of metapackages in order to ease the installation of 
      huge package lists via slapt-get. The recommended
      installation method is to first install the basic GSB GNOME Desktop
      through the <code>gsb-desktop</code> metapackage. It contains all the
      packages required for a working GNOME Desktop, including Epiphany,
      Evolution, the GNOME Display Manager (GDM), NetworkManager, Gslapt
      for package management and some basic themes and desktop utilities.
      From here, additional packages can be added to suit the users needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      This process may take a long time, depending on the speed of your
      connection. It will first download all the required packages and
      install them. There are a few packages installed, such as
      <code>wpa_supplicant, NetworkManager, network-manager-applet, avahi,
      system-backend-tools</code>, that will require a restart of the dbus
      messaging system and some user-made configurations before they are
      properly installed and usable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, <strong>it is strongly recommended</strong> that you read
      the <a href="#configure">Post-Installation and Configuration
      Notes</a> before installing <code>gsb-desktop</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To install this basic GSB Desktop, run:
    </p>

    <div>
      <pre>
$ slapt-get --install gsb-desktop
</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      After installation, it is also <strong>strongly recommended that you
      reboot your system.</strong>

       While GNOME SlackBuild is designed to replace as few Slackware packages as possible,
       it is not possible to free ourselves wholly from replacing some packages.  Some software,
       like Gnumeric, required updated libraries and as a result we need to replace some
       default Slackware packages.

      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_uninstall.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> In order to uninstall GNOME SlackBuild, you'll first need to remove all 
         GNOME SlackBuild packages, and then re-install any Slackware provided packages
         that may have been replaced by GSB ones.  You can remove all GNOME SlackBuild packages
         by running:
    </p>
    
<div>
<pre>
$ removepkg /var/log/packages/*gsb
</pre>
</div>

    <p>This will remove all packages that are provided by GNOME SlackBuild.  If you are using
    slapt-get, then you'll need to comment out the SOURCE for GNOME SlackBuild in your
    <code>/etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc</code> file.  Then make sure to rerun <code>
    slapt-get --update</code>.  After this has finished, you'll be able to reinstall
    the standard Slackware packages by running:</p>

<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --install pango glib2 gtk+2 gnome-icon-theme
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
     You may also need to reinstall other packages that may have been replaced.  
     For a full list of packages that may have been upgraded by GNOME SlackBuild, 
     please see our replaced packages file.
