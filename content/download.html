    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_distribution.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> This is our binary GNOME distribution for Slackware
         Linux. It encompasses all needed packages for a fully
         configurable, customisable and usable GNOME desktop environment
         for Slackware. If you haven&#39;t yet, you should <span
             class="hilite"><a href=
             "/about/">read about the GSB project</a></span> before
         installing GSB.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most current available version of the GSB binary distribution is
      <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?></span>
    </p>

    </h3>

    <p>
      The quickest and easiest way to install the GSB binary distribution,
      is via our net-installer.  Note that this method of installation will
      install <em>everything</em> included in the GSB distribution (full
      installation!).
    </p>

    <p>
      Login to a terminal as root (in run-level 3, preferred), and run the
      following command:
    </p>

    <h4>
      Slackware <?php echo($slack_ver); ?> for x86
    </h4>

    <div>

      <img src="/images/app-icons/slaptget.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> The package management tool used by GNOME SlackBuild is
         slapt-get. Slapt-get tries to emulate Debian&#39;s apt-get as
         closely as possible. It uses native Slackware tools, like
         installpkg, upgradepkg and removepkg, and supports multiple
         package sources. It is also capable of caching packages, resuming
         downloads, checking MD5s, searching packages, and resolving
         dependencies and conflicts. It is the preferred tool when
         installing GNOME SlackBuild. If you would like more information on
         slapt-get please see see Slapt-get&#39;s <a href=
         "http://software.jaos.org/#slapt-get">home page</a>. GSlapt is
         also available, and is a GTK version of slapt-get, which
         integrates well into the GSB GNOME Desktop, and is the default
         package management application.

    </p>

    <p>
      After downloading the slapt-get binary package, you can install it
      with:
    </p>

<div>

      <img src="/images/app-icons/mirrors.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> Once slapt-get is installed, you will need to modify the
         <code>/etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc</code> file to point to local
         mirrors of both a Slackware <span class=
         "version"><?php echo($slack_ver); ?></span> mirror as well as a
         GNOME SlackBuild mirror. You can find a local Slackware mirror
         from the slackware.com mirror list at <a href=
         "http://www.slackware.com/getslack/">http://www.slackware.com/getslack/</a>.
         A full list of available GNOME SlackBuild Mirrors is given in our
         <a href="#mirrors">list of mirrors</a>.  You will need to be aware that 
         there is both an i586 (x86) binary version as well as a k8 (x86_64) binary 
         version to choose from.  Please make sure to select the mirror that reflects 
         the platform you run on. x86_64 binaries will not run on Slackware.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The slapt-getrc file consists currently of the following keys:
      <code>SOURCE WORKINGDIR EXCLUDE</code>.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <var>SOURCE</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        SOURCE must be a path to a valid http or ftp Slackware release
        directory, or other package source such as linuxpackages.net, or
        GNOME SlackBuild. All that is required is the PACKAGES.TXT and
        CHECKSUMS.md5. Multiple sources can be defined. Below is a short
        example <code>slapt-getrc</code> file. <strong>Please note: This is
        only an example. Make sure to change your SOURCE to point to local
        mirrors.</strong>

      <dt>
        <var>WORKINGDIR</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        WORKINGDIR will hold the package data and downloaded packages. This
        directory will be created automatically as permissions allow. Be
        sure that the directory resides on a partition with a large amount
        of free space, because a full GNOME SlackBuild installation can
        download up to 500MB of packages.
      </dd>

      <dt>
        <var>EXCLUDE</var>
      </dt>

      <dd>
        EXCLUDE is a comma separated list of packages you want excluded
        from updating. This can be the package name, or a extended POSIX
        regex. For example, to exclude Dropline GNOME, use .*-[0-9]dl$.  
        But this is just an example.  :^)
       </dd>
       
       <dd>
        <strong>Please make sure that if you are running a x86_64 system, that
        you do not have x86_64 specified in the EXCLUDE section, or no packages
        will be found when trying to install via the slapt-get application.

    <p>
      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_upgrade.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> After installing and customizing the
         <code>slapt-getrc</code> configuration file, you need to run
         slapt-get with the <var>--update</var> option to download the
         package data available from all the package sources you specified
         within the <code>slapt-getrc</code> file. 
    </p>

    <p>After the package data has been updated, the first step to installing
      GNOME SlackBuild is to <strong>upgrade the required packages</strong>.
      If you do not replace the required packages, GNOME SlackBuild will not
      run properly.</p> 
      
    <p>
       To get the most out of your GSB GNOME Desktop, it is recommended that you replace
       a few Slackware packages.  You can easily upgrade these packages first by 
       using slapt-get.  
    </p>
    
<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --upgrade
</pre>
</div>
      
   <p>
      <strong>glib2</strong> and <strong>libwnck</strong> are Slackware packages that must be 
      replaced by the corresponding GNOME SlackBuild versions in order to use GNOME 
      <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?></span> on Slackware 
      <span class="version"><?php echo($slack_ver); ?></span>. Reasons for their 
      replacement are given within brackets.
   </p>
   
<div>
<pre>
*Required Slackware Package Replacements for GNOME <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?></span>*

glib2:            ( > 2.15 required by libgnome 2.22, Gvfs 0.2.3, and Nautilus 2.22)
libwnck:          ( > 2.22 required by Metacity 2.22, and GNOME 2.22 at large)

</pre>
</div>

    <p>
       However, while GNOME SlackBuild is designed to replace as few Slackware packages as 
       possible, it is not possible to free ourselves wholly from replacing some packages.  
       There are three packages that are optional and replace official Slackware packages, 
       but their replacement are only necessary for added functionality, or for certain 
       GNOME applications.  <strong>Their replacement is recommended</strong>, but not 
       required if you do not plan to use certain applications, or are dead set against
       replacing any Slackware provided packages.
    </p>

<div>
<pre>
*Optional Slackware Package Replacements for GNOME <span class="version"><?php echo($gsb_bin_stable_ver); ?></span>*

mozilla-firefox:  
  This is a shared library version of Mozilla Firefox. You must replace the Slackware Mozilla with 
  the GSB version if you plan to use Epiphany (GNOME Browser), Yelp (GNOME Help System), 
  GNOME Python (for the gtkmozembed widget for some Python applications), DevHelp (Developement
  Documentation Browser), or any Mono applications.

compiz-fusion:    
  Slackware 12.1 comes with Compiz 0.7.4, but GSB's Compiz-fusion is much cooler.  ;)

libgsf:
  Slackware's libgsf package lacks GNOME support.  You will need to replace this package with the
  GSB version if you plan on using any GNOME Office software, like Gnumeric, Glom, GNOME Database, etc.

</div>

    <p>
      Below is a list enumerating the various options you can pass to <code>slapt-get</code>

      alt="" /> After replacing the required packages, you are now
      ready to install GNOME SlackBuild.  GNOME SlackBuild provides 
      a number of metapackages in order to ease the installation of 
      huge package lists via slapt-get. The recommended
      installation method is to first install the basic GSB GNOME Desktop
      through the <code>gsb-desktop</code> metapackage. It contains all the
      packages required for a working and useable GNOME Desktop, including Epiphany,
      Evolution, the GNOME Display Manager (GDM), and Gslapt
      for package management as well as some basic themes and desktop utilities.
      From here, additional packages can be added to suit the users needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      To install your basic GNOME SlackBuild GNOME Desktop, run:
    </p>

<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --install gsb-desktop
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      This process may take a long time, depending on the speed of your
      connection. It will first download all the required packages and
      install them. After installation, it is also <strong>strongly recommended that you
      reboot your system.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      As well, <strong>it is recommended</strong> that you read the 
      <a href="#configure">Post-Installation and Configuration Notes</a> 
      before installing <code>gsb-desktop</code>.  There are a few minor changes users
      may wish to make in order to get the best possible GSB system running.

      <img src="/images/app-icons/gsb_uninstall.png"
         class="listimg-l"
         alt="" /> In order to uninstall GNOME SlackBuild, you'll first need to remove all 
         GNOME SlackBuild packages, and then re-install any Slackware provided packages
         that may have been replaced by GSB ones.  It is recommended that you drop to runlevel 1
         (Single-user mode) while you uninstall. You will need your original Slackware CD in order
         to re-install some standard Slackware packages, or else a working internet connection if you
         want to use slapt-get to reinstall these packages. You can remove all GNOME SlackBuild packages
         by running:
    </p>
    
<div>
<pre>
$ removepkg /var/log/packages/*gsb
</pre>
</div>

    <p>This will remove all packages that are provided by GNOME SlackBuild.  You'll need to 
    comment out the SOURCE for GNOME SlackBuild in your <code>/etc/slapt-get/slapt-getrc</code> file.  
    Then make sure to rerun <code>
    slapt-get --update</code>.  After you have uninstalled GNOME SlackBuild, you'll need to reinstall
    a few standard Slackware packages by running:</p>

<div>
<pre>
$ slapt-get --install glib2 libwnck
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
     You may also need to reinstall other packages that may have been replaced, such as mozilla-firefox,
     libgsf, or compiz.
